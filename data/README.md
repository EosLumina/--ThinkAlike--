# ThinkAlike Data Sovereignty

This directory establishes a sovereign domain for project data, separated from code to maintain clear boundaries and explicit control over the information commons.

The separation of data from code represents our commitment to data minimization and user sovereignty - fundamental principles that resist the exploitative practices of conventional digital systems that deliberately blur the boundaries between function and information.
