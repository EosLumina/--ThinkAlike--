# ThinkAlike Revolutionary Roadmap

This living document synchronizes our collective work toward digital liberation, making visible both the path and our progress along it.

## Revolutionary Organization: Swarming Sessions

Swarming sessions represent our commitment to non-hierarchical, purpose-driven collaboration. Rather than traditional assignment of tasks, contributors self-organize around specific liberation objectives.

### Active Swarms

| Swarm Name | Focus Area | Coordinator | Communication Channel | Next Session |
|------------|------------|-------------|------------------------|--------------|
| Data Sovereignty | Implementing user-controlled data visualization | @sovereignty_guide | #swarm-data-sovereignty | 2025-04-18 14:00 UTC |
| Transparency Framework | Building the traceability service UI | @transparency_architect | #swarm-transparency | 2025-04-20 15:30 UTC |
| Consent Mechanics | Implementing granular consent framework | @consent_coordinator | #swarm-consent | 2025-04-19 13:00 UTC |
