# Digital Legacy Framework: User Stories & Examples

This document provides illustrative user stories and examples to demonstrate the value and application of the Digital Legacy Framework in ThinkAlike.

## User Stories

### Maria's Family History Preservation

**User:** Maria, 72, grandmother with rich family history

**Goal:** Preserve stories and wisdom for future generations who never met her

**Story:**
Maria grew up hearing stories from her grandfather about their family's immigration journey. As the keeper of family history, she worries these stories will be lost when she's gone. Using ThinkAlike's Digital Legacy Framework, Maria:

1. Creates a detailed family tree going back three generations
2. Records dozens of family stories in her own voice, tagged by theme and relevant family members
3. Answers structured questions about her values, beliefs, and life lessons
4. Provides photos and documents with contextual information
5. Sets permissions for her stories to become available to all verified descendants
6. Opts-in to AI-assisted conversation, allowing future generations to ask questions about the stories she's shared

**Outcome:** Years later, Maria's great-granddaughter Sarah, who never met her, connects with Maria's legacy. She learns about family traditions, sees photos with Maria's own commentary, and even asks questions about aspects of stories she's curious about. The AI, drawing only from Maria's recordings and writings, provides answers in a way that preserves Maria's unique voice and perspective.

### Professor Chen's Historical Knowledge

**User:** Professor Chen, historical scholar specializing in civil rights movement

**Goal:** Create an educational resource preserving decades of research and personal interviews

**Story:**
Professor Chen has spent 40 years interviewing civil rights leaders, collecting oral histories, and developing expertise that isn't captured in his published works. Concerned about preserving this knowledge, he uses the Digital Legacy Framework to:

1. Create a verified academic profile with his credentials and body of work
2. Upload transcripts from hundreds of interviews with proper attribution and context
3. Record his analysis and perspectives on historical events
4. Organize content by theme, historical period, and related figures
5. Set ethical boundaries for AI representation based on academic standards
6. Make content available to verified educational institutions

**Outcome:** After Professor Chen's retirement, his digital legacy becomes an invaluable resource for students and researchers. They can explore his organized knowledge base and ask questions that draw on his expertise. The system clearly indicates which responses come directly from recordings versus which are synthesized from his body of work, maintaining academic integrity.

### The Johnson Family Collective History

**User:** The Johnson family, with members spread across three continents

**Goal:** Create a shared family history that preserves their multicultural heritage

**Story:**
The Johnson family has branches in the United States, Nigeria, and the UK, with rich cultural traditions that younger generations fear losing connection to. Together, they use the Digital Legacy Framework to:

1. Collaboratively build a comprehensive family tree with international branches
2. Record traditional songs, recipes, and ceremonies from elder members
3. Document family migration stories and historical context
4. Preserve multilingual expressions and phrases that are important to family identity
5. Create a shared permission structure allowing all verified family members access
6. Establish regular virtual gatherings where they interact with preserved content together

**Outcome:** The family creates a living archive that strengthens bonds across geographical distance and generations. When elder members pass away, their contributions remain accessible, helping younger members maintain connection to their heritage. The collaborative nature of the project itself becomes a new family tradition that reinforces their shared identity.

### Roberto's Ethical Will

**User:** Roberto, tech entrepreneur diagnosed with terminal illness at 45

**Goal:** Leave guidance and values for his young children who won't remember him

**Story:**
Roberto has children aged 3 and 5 when he receives a terminal diagnosis. Wanting to remain a presence in their lives as they grow, he uses the Digital Legacy Framework to create an ethical will:

1. Records video messages for specific future milestones (graduations, weddings, etc.)
2. Creates age-appropriate content that will unlock as his children grow
3. Answers hundreds of life advice questions he anticipates they might ask
4. Documents his values, beliefs, and hopes for their future
5. Works with his partner to establish appropriate access controls
6. Opts for basic AI representation limited to topics he explicitly addressed

**Outcome:** As Roberto's children grow, they have access to their father's guidance at key life moments. The system provides age-appropriate content when they reach certain milestones. His partner can help contextualize the messages, creating a sense of continued connection rather than just preserved memories.
