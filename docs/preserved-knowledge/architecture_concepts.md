# Architecture Concepts

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the architectural concepts that form the foundation of ThinkAlike's technical implementation.

## 2. Layered Architecture

ThinkAlike employs a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns:

* **Presentation Layer**: React/TypeScript frontend components

* **Application Layer**: FastAPI routes and services

* **Domain Layer**: Core business logic and models

* **Infrastructure Layer**: Database, authentication, and external services

## 3. UI as Validation Framework

The UI as Validation Framework is implemented through:

* **Component-Level Validation**: UI components that validate their own state against requirements

* **API Integration Checks**: Components that validate successful API communication

* **Ethical Compliance Indicators**: Visual indicators of ethical guideline adherence

* **Data Flow Visualization**: Components that trace data through the system

## 4. Value Profile & Matching System

The architectural implementation of the Value Profile includes:

* **Core Values Schema**: Flexible JSON schema for representing user values

* **Progressive Profile Building**: Incremental profile enhancement through various interaction points

* **Matching Algorithm Pipeline**: Multi-stage process for compatibility calculation

* **Profile Privacy Controls**: Granular permissions system for profile visibility

## 5. Data Sovereignty Architecture

Our data sovereignty implementation includes:

* **User Data Repository**: Centralized access point for all user data

* **Consent Management System**: Tracking and enforcing user permissions

* **Data Portability Services**: Import/export functionality for user data

* **Audit Trail**: Complete history of data access and modifications

## 6. Decentralized Community Framework

The architectural foundation for community self-governance includes:

* **Policy Management System**: Tools for communities to create and enforce rules

* **Voting Mechanisms**: Flexible voting systems for community decisions

* **Moderation Queue**: Community-managed content moderation

* **Federation Capabilities**: Future-ready design for potential federation

## 7. Security Architecture

Our security architecture incorporates:

* **Zero-Trust Model**: No implicit trust for any network or component

* **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers throughout the system

* **Privacy by Design**: Privacy considerations at every development stage

* **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time security analysis and alerting

## 8. Testing & Quality Framework

Our architecture incorporates testing through:

* **Automated Test Suite**: Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests

* **Property-Based Testing**: Testing of invariants and properties

* **UI-Driven Validation**: Using the UI components for validation

* **Ethical Compliance Tests**: Tests specifically for ethical guidelines
