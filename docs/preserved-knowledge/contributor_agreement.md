# ThinkAlike Contributor Pledge: Architecting an Ethical Future (Draft)

---

## Preamble: A Commitment to the Vision

By accepting this pledge, you signify a deeper resonance with the core vision of ThinkAlike â€“ building ethical technology for authentic connection and positive societal change, grounded in the principles of Enlightenment 2.0 ([See Manifesto](../../core/manifesto/manifesto.md)). This is a voluntary expression of your interest in potentially contributing your unique skills and perspectives to this open-source movement, beyond your role as a standard user.

## Your Pledge (Voluntary)

* You commit to upholding the project's [Code of Conduct](../../core/code_of_conduct.md) in all community interactions.

* You understand contributions ([Contribution Guide](../../core/contributing.md)) are voluntary under open-source licenses ([License Details](../../readme.md#license)).

* You aspire to contribute constructively towards the project's ethical goals and the realization of Enlightenment 2.0 principles through technology.

## What This Pledge Enables (Potential - TBD)

* This is **NOT** an employment agreement.

* Accepting may grant access to specific 'Architect' or 'Contributor' channels on our communication platforms (e.g., Discord).

* May provide early access to certain features for feedback and testing.

* May unlock a 'Contributor/Architect' badge on your ThinkAlike profile (optional display).

* You can step back from active contribution at any time without penalty.

## Data & Privacy

* Your acceptance of this pledge will be associated with your user profile to enable potential contributor features/access. It does not alter the handling of your core personal data under our main [Data Handling Policy](../../guides/developer_guides/data_handling_policy_guide.md).
