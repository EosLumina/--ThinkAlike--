# Digital Legacy Framework: Family Trees & Posthumous Connections

## Concept Overview

The Digital Legacy Framework extends ThinkAlike's mission of authentic connection across the temporal dimension, creating what we call "timeline transcendence" - the ability for wisdom, stories, and connection to flow beyond physical lifetimes. This feature enables users to:

1. Build interactive family trees with rich metadata
2. Opt-in to personality preservation for posthumous representation
3. Preserve memories, wisdom, and stories for future generations
4. Interact with digital representations of ancestors and historical figures

This framework directly supports ThinkAlike's core ethics of user sovereignty, radical transparency, and meaningful connection while addressing the profound human desire to connect across generations.

## User Stories

### Core User Experiences

* As a user, I want to create a comprehensive family tree to visualize my ancestral connections
* As a user, I want to preserve my stories, wisdom, and personality traits for future generations
* As a user, I want to specify exactly what aspects of my digital self are preserved and how they may be accessed
* As a descendant, I want to learn about my ancestors through their preserved digital legacy
* As a descendant, I want to have conversations with AI representations of my ancestors that authentically reflect their values, personality, and knowledge
* As a historian, I want to create authenticated digital representations of historical figures based on their writings and records
* As an educator, I want students to interact with historical figures to gain deeper understanding of their context and thoughts

### Edge Cases & Special Considerations

* As a user with complex or non-traditional family structures, I need flexible relationship mapping that accommodates my family reality
* As someone estranged from family members, I need control over who can connect to my family tree node
* As someone concerned about exploitation, I need guarantees that my digital legacy won't be misused or misrepresented
* As an executor, I need tools to implement the digital wishes of someone who has passed away
