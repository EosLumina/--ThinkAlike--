    "Our CI/CD workflows are failing in several jobs. Use the following steps to diagnose and resolve the issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Review Logs**:\n",
    "   - Check detailed logs from failing jobs (e.g., Build, Test, Deploy).\n",
    "   - Identify which steps are failing or timing out.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Verify Dependencies**:\n",
    "   - Ensure that `requirements.txt` and `requirements-test.txt` correctly pin versions (e.g., numpy, pandas, etc.).\n",
    "   - Update any dependencies if necessary to resolve conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Consolidate Workflows**:\n",
    "   - Confirm that there are no redundant or conflicting workflows running in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Optimize Test Execution**:\n",
    "   - If tests are timing out, try increasing timeout limits or optimizing test cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Merge Stable Changes**:\n",
    "   - Once the fixes are verified by re-running the pipelines, merge the changes into main."
