## Using AI Coding Assistants

We encourage using AI assistants (Copilot, Gemini) to improve efficiency, but **you are responsible for your contributions.** Treat AI as an *augmenting tool*, not a replacement for understanding, critical thinking, and ethical judgment.

**Best Practices:**
* **Understand Suggestions:** **Carefully review, understand, and validate** all AI-generated code.
* **Test Rigorously:** Test AI code thoroughly, especially edge cases, security, ethics. Use UI validation components.
* **Ethical Alignment:** Ensure AI code aligns with ThinkAlike's principles (no bias, opacity, manipulation). Use Verification System/UI validation.
* **Use for Repetitive Tasks:** Leverage AI for boilerplate/repetitive tasks, retaining human oversight on critical decisions.
* **Provide Clear Prompts:** Give specific context, specifications (link docs), and **ethical requirements**.

**Example Prompts (Tailored for ThinkAlike):**
* **Understanding a Component:**
