# Project Overview

## Introduction

ThinkAlike is an **open-source platform** designed to foster **genuine human connections** through **ethical technology** and **user empowerment**. It moves beyond superficial online interactions, aiming to help users:

* **Discover Themselves:** Explore values, beliefs, perspectives, and aspirations, primarily via **Mode 1 (Narrative Onboarding)**.
* **Connect with Like-Minded Individuals:** Find value-aligned connections using transparent **Mode 2 (Profile Discovery)** features.
* **Build Meaningful Relationships:** Bridge online interactions to real-world community and collaboration via **Mode 3 (Community Building)**.
* **Collaborate:** Build real-world connections within communities.
* **Contribute to a Better Future:** Participate in a community dedicated to building responsible, human-centered technology.

* **Discover Themselves:** Explore their values, beliefs, and aspirations.
* **Connect with Like-Minded Individuals:** Find others who share similar values and goals.
* **Build Meaningful Relationships:** Transition online interactions into real-world connections.
* **Contribute to a Better Future:** Participate in a community dedicated to ethical AI and responsible technology.
* **Collaborate:** Build real-world connections.

ThinkAlike leverages AI as a *tool* to *enhance* human connection and insight, not replace user agency. The platform prioritizes **Radical Transparency**, **User Sovereignty**, and ethical data handling, built on the principles of **"Enlightenment 2.0"** â€“ using technology to promote reason, knowledge, and human flourishing ([See Principles](./enlightenment_2_0/ENLIGHTENMENT_2_0_PRINCIPLES.md)). It stands as a conscious alternative to exploitative digital platforms.

**(Refer to the [`MASTER_REFERENCE.md`](./master_reference.md) for definitive concepts and terminology).**

## Core Values

ThinkAlike is guided by the following core values:

* **Human-Centered Approach:** Prioritizing user well-being, dignity, and agency.

## Key Features & Concepts

ThinkAlike's functionality is organized around several key areas and concepts:

* **Three Interaction Modes:**
    1.  **Mode 1: Personalized Narrative Journeys:** An interactive experience helping users explore values via guided prompts, assisted by an AI agent. ([Modes Overview](../architecture/modes/modes_overview.md))
    2.  **Mode 2: Profile Discovery & Connection:** Users explore potential connections based on Value Profiles, interacting via AI Clones/Avatars and initiating connections through Narrative Compatibility Tests.
    3.  **Mode 3: Community Building Tools:** Features facilitating decentralized community formation, governance, communication, and collaboration.
* **Value Profiles:** Nuanced, dynamic user representations of values, stances, and interests, driving connections.
* **Ethical AI Matching:** An intelligent system connecting users based on shared values and lifestyles, *not* superficial metrics. The AI's reasoning is transparent and explainable. ([Matching Algorithm Guide](../guides/developer_guides/matching_algorithm_guide.md)).
* **Data Traceability Visualization:** A unique, interactive UI component visually demonstrating data origins, usage, and influence on AI recommendations, central to our transparency commitment. ([DataTraceability Spec](../components/ui_components/data_traceability.md))
* **AI Clones / AI-Powered Video Avatars:** Dynamic visual/interactive representations of users, enhancing understanding in Mode 1 & 2 before direct connection.
* **Narrative Compatibility Tests:** User-initiated interaction gates in Mode 2 to ensure alignment before deeper connection.
* **Decentralized Communities:** User-created and governed groups in Mode 3.
* **UI as Validation Framework:** A unique approach using UI components for real-time testing, validation, and ethical enforcement during development. ([UI Validation Examples](../guides/developer_guides/ui_validation_examples.md)).
* **Verification System:** A backend engine ensuring system operations align with ethical and functional rules. ([Verification System Spec](../architecture/verification_system/verification_system.md))
* **Collective Empowerment:** Features supporting group collaboration, shared data understanding, and potentially collective data/privacy preference setting within communities.

## Technology Stack

* **Frontend:** React (Create React App, TypeScript planned), Zustand (State Management recommended)
* **Backend:** Python 3.9+, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy (ORM)
* **Database:** SQLite (Development), PostgreSQL (Production), Alembic (Migrations)
* **Authentication:** JWT
* **AI/ML:** Python libraries (Initially rule-based, planning for advanced models like collaborative filtering, NLP. See [AI Dev Guide](../guides/developer_guides/ai/ai_model_development_guide.md))
* **Deployment:** Render (initially), Docker
* **Documentation:** Markdown, Mermaid.js, Highlight.js (rendered via `docs/index.html`), with plans to explore static site generators like MkDocs.

* **Ethical AI Matching:** An intelligent matchmaking system that connects users based on shared values, interests, and lifestyles, *not* superficial metrics or manipulative algorithms.  The AI's decision-making process is transparent and explainable.
* **Data Traceability Visualization:**  A unique, interactive "Data Traceability" component that visually shows users *exactly* how their data is being used, where it's coming from, and how it influences AI recommendations. This component is central to the platform's commitment to transparency.
* **Personalized Narrative Journeys (Mode 1):**  An interactive experience that helps users explore their own values and beliefs through a series of guided questions and prompts. The AI agent assists in this process, providing personalized insights and recommendations.
* **AI-Powered Video Avatars (Mode 2):**  Users can interact with AI-powered video representations of other users to get a better sense of their personality and interaction style *before* making a direct connection. This helps bridge the gap between online profiles and real-world interactions.
* **Community Building Tools (Mode 3):** Features to facilitate the formation and growth of communities based on shared interests and goals. This includes tools for group communication, collaboration, and event organization.
* **UI-Driven Development and Testing:** A unique approach where the UI itself serves as a testing and validation framework for code, data, and AI. This promotes ethical and user-centered development.
* **Collective Empowerment:** Features to support group collaboration, shared data understanding, and collective decision-making, allowing communities to define their own data usage and privacy preferences.

## Technology Stack

* **Frontend:** React (Create React App)
* **Backend:** Python (FastAPI)
* **Database:** SQLite (for development), PostgreSQL (planned for production)
* **AI:** Initially a rule-based system for matching and data traceability visualization. Future plans include exploring more advanced models (e.g., collaborative filtering, natural language processing) for enhanced personalization and community features.
* **Documentation:** Markdown, rendered with `marked.js` and `mermaid.js` (with plans to migrate to a static site generator like MkDocs).

## Architecture

ThinkAlike follows a modular, three-tier architecture focused on separation of concerns, testability, and ethical alignment:

1.  **Presentation Layer (UI):** React frontend.
2.  **Application Layer (API, Logic):** Python/FastAPI backend, business logic, AI integration.
3.  **Data Layer (Database, Storage):** SQLite/PostgreSQL persistence.

1. **Presentation Layer (UI):** The React-based frontend, responsible for user interaction and data display.
2. **Application Layer (API, Logic):** The Python/FastAPI backend, handling API requests, business logic, and AI model integration.
3. **Data Layer (Database, Storage):**  Stores user data, AI model data, and other persistent information.

See the [`Architectural Overview`](../architecture/architectural_overview.md) and [`Architectural Design Specifications`](../architecture/design/architectural_design_specifications.md) for details. *(A Mermaid diagram illustrating the architecture is also included in the `ONBOARDING_GUIDE.md` file.)*
