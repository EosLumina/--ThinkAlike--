# Digital Sovereignty: A Revolutionary Principle

Digital sovereignty embodies our fundamental commitment to human autonomy in digital spaces.
It recognizes that true liberation requires:

1. Complete control over one's digital presence and data
2. Transparency in all systems that process personal information
3. Freedom from invisible exploitation mechanisms
4. The right to understand and modify the systems that shape our digital experience

This document serves as a test of our documentation sovereignty system, which ensures
that our knowledge commons remains free from unauthorized modification.
