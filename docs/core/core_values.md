# ThinkAlike Core Values

This document outlines the core values that guide all aspects of ThinkAlike's development and operation. While [Core Concepts](/docs/core/core_concepts.md) explains the fundamental ideas behind ThinkAlike and [Vision Principles](/docs/vision/vision_principles.md) addresses how these manifest in our vision, this document focuses specifically on our foundational values.

## 1. Human-Centered Approach

We champion human dignity, agency, and well-being above all else. Technology serves user choice and freedom, validated by our UI. All features and decisions prioritize genuine human needs over technological convenience or business metrics.

## 2. Ethical AI & Technology

We develop AI and technology that is transparent, accountable, and designed to amplify human capabilities, while respecting privacy, security, and human autonomy. Data parameters will always be clear and actionable.

## 3. Radical Transparency

All processes are traceable via clear UI, rejecting "black box" technologies. We commit to maximum possible openness regarding system operations, particularly data processing workflows, algorithmic decision-making, and governance processes.

## 4. User Sovereignty & Empowerment

Users remain in charge of their data, decisions, and architectural preferences. Our technology enhances user agency and self-determination, using data to support, not dictate, individual needs.

## 5. Authenticity & Meaningful Connection

We foster genuine, value-based relationships that extend beyond fleeting interactions into the real world. We prioritize depth over breadth, meaningful engagement over addictive behavior loops.

## 6. Social Responsibility

We are dedicated to social equity and creating a positive impact, enhancing user skills, and solving real-world problems. We consider the broader societal implications of our technology.

## 7. Community-Driven Development

Our system is shaped by community input, user experience, and unwavering ethical commitment. We embrace open-source principles and collaborative development.

## 8. Ecological Awareness

We recognize the environmental impact of technology and strive to minimize our ecological footprint through efficient code, sustainable practices, and conscious growth strategies.
