# Workflow Security Fixes

## Issue
GitHub workflow files contained structural issues preventing proper validation.

## Resolution
Created and applied the workflow_fixer.py script to:
- Remove invalid shell commands from workflow files
- Ensure proper YAML syntax
- Validate required keys are present
- Create proper validation scripts

## Prevention
Regular CI validation now ensures these issues won't recur.
