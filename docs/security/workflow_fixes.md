# Workflow Security Fixes

## Issue
GitHub workflow files contained structural issues preventing proper validation and creating potential security risks.

## Resolution
Created and applied workflow fixer scripts to:
- Remove invalid shell commands from workflow files
- Ensure proper YAML syntax with quoted 'on' keys
- Validate required keys are present
- Create proper validation scripts
- Organize infrastructure scripts in a maintainable way

## Prevention
Regular CI validation now ensures these issues won't recur. The project includes:
- `validate_workflows.py` - Validates workflow YAML structure
- `check_security.py` - Verifies dependency security requirements
- `project_status.py` - Complete project health check

## Security Benefits
These improvements enhance security by:
1. Preventing injection attacks through malformed YAML
2. Ensuring dependencies meet minimum security requirements
3. Maintaining clear boundaries between different CI/CD processes
4. Providing transparency into system operations
