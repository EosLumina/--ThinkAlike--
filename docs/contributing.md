## Code Review Process

All code contributions to ThinkAlike are subject to code review to ensure code quality, ethical compliance, and adherence to project guidelines. Code review will be conducted by project maintainers and experienced community members.

**During code review, reviewers will focus on:**
- **Functionality:** Is the code implementing intended functionality correctly and efficiently?
- **Code Quality:** Is it clean, readable, well-documented, and maintainable while following the Code Style Guidelines?
- **Ethical Compliance:** Does it adhere to the Ethical Guidelines to promote data transparency, user empowerment, and ethical AI?
- **Testing:** Are there adequate tests (unit, integration, and UI) to ensure robustness? Is UI testing used effectively for data validation and workflow integrity?
- **Data Traceability:** Are data flows clear and traceable? Are UI components effectively visualizing data flow and validating data handling processes?
- **Security:** Does the code follow secure coding practices and data privacy protocols?
- **UI/UX:** Does it integrate seamlessly with UI/UX design, enhancing user experience and promoting transparency and control?

Be prepared to receive feedback on your code and iterate on your contributions based on the review process. Code review is a collaborative and learning process aimed at improving overall quality and ethical integrity.

## Community and Communication

We believe in building a strong and supportive community around ThinkAlike. Please use the following channels for communication:
- **GitHub Repository:** [https://github.com/Willeede/thinkalike_project](https://github.com/Willeede/thinkalike_project) – For code contributions, issue tracking, and technical discussions.

## Using AI Coding Assistants

We encourage the use of AI coding assistants like Copilot or Gemini to improve coding efficiency. However, **you are ultimately responsible for the code you contribute.**

**Best Practices for Using AI Assistants:**
- **Understand AI Suggestions:** Always review, understand, and validate every line of AI-generated code.
- **Test AI-Generated Code Rigorously:** Test AI suggestions thoroughly, especially edge cases, security vulnerabilities, and ethical implications. Use UI validation components to verify AI behavior.
- **Ensure Ethical Alignment:** Confirm that AI-generated code aligns with ThinkAlike's ethical principles and does not introduce bias or opacity.
- **Use AI for Repetitive Tasks:** Leverage AI to automate repetitive tasks and generate boilerplate code while retaining oversight on critical decisions.
- **Provide Clear Prompts:** Offer the AI clear context, specifications, and ethical requirements when generating code.

**Example Prompts for AI Assistants:**
- To understand a component:
    > "Explain the purpose and functionality of the following React component in the ThinkAlike project, including how it contributes to data traceability and user empowerment, and the meaning of each prop and the expected data types:
    >  ```jsx
    >  [Paste component code here]
    >  ```"
- To write tests, refactor code, document, or debug—always include context and ethical considerations alongside the required functionality.

Thank you for contributing to ThinkAlike! Together, we can build a more ethical and human-centered digital world.
