## Getting Started

**Q1: I'm new here. Where should I start reading?**

A: We highly recommend starting with the **"Recommended Reading Path"** outlined in the [`Onboarding Guide`](../core/onboarding_guide.md). It provides a structured way to understand the project's vision, core concepts, architecture, and ethical foundations before diving into code or specific tasks. Key documents include the Manifesto, Project Overview, Master Reference, Ethical Guidelines, and then the Installation/Contribution guides.

**Q2: What skills do I need to contribute?**

A: We welcome contributors with a wide range of skills!
*   **Frontend:** React, TypeScript/JavaScript, CSS, HTML, understanding UI/UX principles, experience with state management and API integration.
*   **Backend:** Python, FastAPI (or willingness to learn), SQLAlchemy (or ORMs), database design (PostgreSQL/SQLite), REST API principles, authentication (JWT).
*   **AI/ML:** Python, experience with NLP libraries (like spaCy, Transformers) or ML frameworks (Scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow) for tasks like text analysis, recommendation systems, or ethical AI validation (interest in XAI and bias mitigation is a plus!).
*   **UI/UX Design:** Figma (or similar), understanding user-centered design, accessibility (WCAG), creating wireframes, mockups, prototypes, visual design systems.
*   **Testing/QA:** Experience with testing frameworks (Pytest, Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress), writing test cases, manual testing, performance testing, security testing, accessibility testing.
*   **Documentation:** Strong writing skills, experience with Markdown, ability to explain technical concepts clearly.
*   **Ethics & Policy:** Background in applied ethics, AI ethics, data privacy law (GDPR/CCPA), policy writing, community moderation principles.
*   **DevOps/Infrastructure:** Experience with Docker, CI/CD (GitHub Actions), cloud deployment (Render), database administration (PostgreSQL).

Even if you're learning, your enthusiasm and willingness to adhere to our values are highly appreciated!

**Q3: How do I set up the project locally?**

A: Follow the detailed steps in the [`Installation Guide`](../core/installation.md). It covers prerequisites, cloning, setting up the Python backend environment, Node.js frontend environment, database initialization, and running the servers. If you hit issues, consult the [`Troubleshooting Guide`](../architecture/deployment_troubleshooting.md).

**Q4: What are the main tools used for project management and communication?**

A:
*   **GitHub:** Our central hub for code hosting, version control, issue tracking ([Link - TODO]), pull requests, project boards, and documentation.
*   **[Primary Communication Channel - e.g., Discord/Slack]:** [Link - TODO] This is where we have real-time discussions, ask questions, share updates, and build community. Please join!

## Making Contributions

**Q5: How do I find something to work on?**

A: Check the GitHub Issue Tracker ([Link - TODO]). Look for issues tagged `good first issue` or `help wanted`. You can also filter by labels related to your skills or interests (e.g., `frontend`, `backend`, `documentation`, `mode-2`). If you have your own idea, feel free to open a new issue first to discuss it. Please comment on an issue to claim it before starting work. See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../core/contributing.md) for more detail.

**Q6: What's the process for submitting code changes?**

A: We follow a standard Fork & Pull Request workflow:
1.  Assign/Claim an issue on GitHub.
2.  Fork the main repository.
3.  Clone your fork locally.
4.  Create a descriptive feature branch (e.g., `feat/123-add-profile-editing`).
5.  Make your changes, adhering to the [`Code Style Guide`](./developer_guides/code_style_guide.md) and including tests.
6.  Commit your changes using the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format.
7.  Push the branch to your fork.
8.  Open a Pull Request (PR) back to the main repository's `main` branch.
9.  Link the issue your PR addresses. Describe your changes clearly.
10. Engage in the code review process, address feedback, and wait for approval and merge.
(See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../core/contributing.md) for full details).

**Q7: What are "Conventional Commits"? Why are they important?**

A: It's a specification for formatting commit messages (e.g., `feat: ...`, `fix: ...`, `docs: ...`). We use it because it creates a clear commit history and allows for automated changelog generation. Please follow this format for all your commits.

**Q8: What are the expectations for code quality and testing?**

A: We strive for "Perfect Coding" â€“ code that is clean, readable, maintainable, efficient, *and* ethically sound/transparent.
*   Follow the [`Code Style Guide`](./developer_guides/code_style_guide.md).
*   Write meaningful unit and integration tests for your code. See the [`Testing and Validation Plan`](./developer_guides/testing_and_validation_plan.md).
*   Ensure your code integrates with and respects the "UI as Validation Framework" where applicable. See [`UI Validation Examples`](./developer_guides/ui_validation_examples.md).
*   Document new functions, classes, or complex logic clearly. Use the [`Code Documentation Template`](../templates/code_documentation_template.md).

**Q9: What is the "UI as Validation Framework"?**

A: This is a core ThinkAlike concept where UI components are designed to actively help validate data, API calls, and ethical rules during development and testing, providing immediate feedback. Check the [`Onboarding Guide`](../core/onboarding_guide.md) section on this and the [`UI Validation Examples`](./developer_guides/ui_validation_examples.md) guide for details on how to use components like `APIValidator` and `CoreValuesValidator`.

## Project Philosophy & Ethics

**Q10: How seriously are the Ethical Guidelines taken?**

A: Extremely seriously. They are the foundation of the project. All contributions, technical decisions, and community interactions must align with the [`Ethical Guidelines`](../core/ethics/ethical_guidelines.md). Code reviewers will specifically check for ethical considerations. Features or code violating these guidelines will need revision.

**Q11: What does "Enlightenment 2.0" mean in practice for this project?**

A: It means building technology that promotes reason, user autonomy, transparency, ethical reflection, and genuine human connection, rather than manipulation, addiction, or data exploitation. It guides our feature design (e.g., value-based matching, transparent AI) and our architecture (e.g., user control, Verification System). See [`Enlightenment 2.0 Principles`](../core/enlightenment_2_0/ENLIGHTENMENT_2_0_PRINCIPLES.md).

**Q12: How does ThinkAlike handle user data and privacy?**

A: With utmost respect and adherence to strict ethical principles. Key points: Data Minimization (collect only what's needed), User Control (users own and manage their data), Transparency (clear policies, traceable data flows via UI), Security (encryption, secure practices), No Exploitation (we don't sell user data or use it for manipulative advertising). See the [`Data Handling Policy Guide`](./developer_guides/data_handling_policy_guide.md) and [`Security & Privacy Plan`](../architecture/security/security_and_privacy_plan.md).

## Miscellaneous

**Q13: Is there compensation for contributing?**

A: ThinkAlike is primarily a volunteer-driven, open-source project aiming for ethical sustainability. While we don't currently offer salaries, we are committed to fair compensation as funding allows. Our [`Funding Model`](../core/funding_model.md) outlines plans for using donations and grants to potentially fund bounties, stipends, or grants for significant contributions in the future.

**Q14: How often is the documentation updated?**

A: We strive to keep documentation up-to-date with development. Key documents like the `MASTER_REFERENCE.md` are intended to be living documents. If you find outdated or incorrect information, please open an issue or submit a PR!
