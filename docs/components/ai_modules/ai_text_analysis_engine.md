# AI Text Analysis Engine

## Purpose
Analyze user-generated text (e.g., profiles, messages) to extract sentiment, keywords, and stylistic features while upholding ethical principles.

## Expected Inputs
- Text content from user inputs.
- Optional metadata for context (e.g., language, user preferences).

## Processing Logic
- Use NLP libraries (e.g., spaCy, NLTK) to perform sentiment analysis and keyword extraction.
- Enforce ethical guidelines to avoid misinterpretation.
- Generate a JSON object with analysis results.

## Expected Outputs
Example:
```json
{
  "sentiment": "positive",
  "keywords": ["authentic", "creative", "collaborative"],
  "style_score": 85
}
```

## Integration
- Called by the matching or profile service.
- Outputs are stored for personalization and AI recommendations.

## Ethical Considerations
- **Transparency:** Users must be informed about text analysis and its purpose.
- **Consent:** Explicit user consent is required for text analysis.
- **Bias Mitigation:** Regular audits to ensure fairness and avoid biases in sentiment or keyword extraction.
- **Privacy:** Text data is anonymized and securely stored.

## Verification System
- Logs analysis events and results.
- Tracks user consent and provides audit trails.
- Allows users to view and delete analysis results via the `Data Explorer Panel`.

## Security
- Ensure text data is encrypted both in transit and at rest.
- Implement strict access controls to prevent unauthorized use.
