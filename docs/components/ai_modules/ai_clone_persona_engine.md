# AI Clone Persona Engine

## Purpose

The AI Clone Persona Engine is designed to analyze user-provided short video introductions (with explicit consent) to extract key audiovisual features that inform the dynamic styling of the user's AI Clone. This engine aims to create a digital proxy that represents the user's persona more accurately than static images or text alone.

## Expected Inputs

* **Video Input:** A short video file or stream provided by the user.

* **User Profile Data (Optional):** Supplemental data (e.g., age, gender, stylistic preferences) to offer contextual guidance during analysis.

## Processing Logic

* **Feature Extraction:** Objectively extract stylistic features such as:

  * **Speech Cadence:** Measures the pace and rhythm of speech.

  * **Visual Style Cues:** Analyzes dominant color palettes, brightness, saturation, and contrast.

  * **Basic Metadata:** Collects non-sensitive data regarding video quality and lighting.

* **Output Generation:** Compile the extracted features into a structured JSON object that serves as the basis for rendering the AI Clone.

## Expected Outputs

A structured JSON object with style parameters, for example:

```
{
  "hue": "value",
  "saturation": "value",
  "brightness": "value",
  "waveform_pattern": "value",
  "speech_cadence_factor": "value"
}

```

These parameters are used by the frontend rendering component to dynamically style the user's AI Clone.

## Integration

* **Frontend Integration:** The JSON output is consumed by the AI Clone rendering component to generate a dynamic avatar.

* **Database Storage:** Generated parameters can be stored and retrieved to ensure consistency across sessions.

* **API Communication:** Results are returned via secure API endpoints to maintain data integrity and privacy.

## Ethical Considerations

* **Consent and Privacy:** Explicit user consent is required for video analysis. The engine strictly avoids sensitive biometric or emotion detection.

* **Transparency:** Users are informed about what data is analyzed and how it is used to generate style parameters.

* **User Empowerment:** Users have the option to manually override or adjust the generated parameters via the UI.

* **Bias Mitigation:** The processing focuses solely on objective stylistic features to prevent any bias.
