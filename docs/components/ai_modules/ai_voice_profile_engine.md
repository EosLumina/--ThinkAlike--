# AI Component: AI Voice Profile Engine

## 1. Purpose

This AI module analyzes the audio track from user-uploaded short video introductions ([API Endpoint `POST /users/me/video`](../../architecture/api/api_endpoints.md)) to extract key vocal characteristics. Its **sole purpose** is to generate parameters that can inform a Text-to-Speech (TTS) or voice synthesis system, allowing the user's **AI Clone** avatar to potentially utter brief, generic phrases (e.g., greetings, confirmation sounds during narrative tests) with voice qualities generally similar to the user's (e.g., pitch range, cadence). This contributes to the "gradual clues" concept before direct communication is enabled.

**Crucially, this engine does NOT perform speech-to-text, analyze semantic content, or detect emotions.** It focuses only on measurable vocal features relevant for basic voice parameterization.

## 2. Inputs

*   Processed audio stream/file derived from the user's video intro (provided via backend pipeline).
*   User ID for context.
*   Explicit user consent flag confirming permission for this specific analysis.

## 3. Processing Logic

*   [Details TBD: Requires specific audio processing libraries (e.g., Librosa, Praat (via wrapper), or specialized models)].
*   Extracts features like:
    *   Fundamental Frequency (Pitch) average and range.
    *   Speech Rate / Cadence (syllables/words per second).
    *   Potentially basic spectral features related to timbre (use cautiously).
*   **Strictly Avoids:** Emotion detection, speaker identification beyond parameter generation, linguistic analysis.
*   Maps extracted features to parameters usable by a target TTS/synthesis system.

## 4. Outputs

*   A JSON object containing voice parameterization data. The exact structure depends on the chosen TTS/synthesis approach. Example (Conceptual):
    ```json
    {
      "pitch_base_hz": 185.0,
      "pitch_range_hz": 120.0,
      "speech_rate_wpm": 150,
      "timbre_model_ref": "general_male_resonant_v1" // Or specific feature vector
    }
    ```
*   This output is likely stored in the database, associated with the user's profile or AI Clone data.

## 5. Integration

*   Called By: User/Profile Service or AI Clone Persona Engine (after video processing and consent check).
*   Writes To: Database (e.g., `Profiles.ai_clone_voice_params`).
*   Provides Data To: A separate Text-to-Speech (TTS) engine (potentially a 3rd Party API like Google TTS, AWS Polly, or an open-source model) which would use these parameters *along with* generic text snippets to generate audio for the AI Clone. *This engine itself likely does not generate audible speech.*
*   Verification System: Logs analysis events, checks consent flags, potentially audits parameters against bias metrics if applicable.

## 6. Ethical Considerations

*   **Consent is Paramount:** Requires separate, explicit opt-in consent for voice analysis *specifically for cloning parameter generation*.
*   **Purpose Limitation:** Generated parameters used *only* for AI Clone generic utterances within ThinkAlike. No other use permitted.
*   **Transparency:** Users must be informed analysis occurs and can view/delete generated parameters via [`Data Explorer Panel`](../../guides/ui_component_specs/data_explorer_panel.md). Use tracked in [`AI Transparency Log`](../../guides/developer_guides/ai/ai_transparency_log.md).
*   **Avoid Deepfakes:** Use feature extraction, not full voice cloning models, unless technology matures and ethical safeguards are exceptionally robust. Aim for characteristic similarity, not perfect mimicry.
*   **Bias:** Audio analysis models can have biases (e.g., based on gender, accent). Rigorous testing needed ([`AI Ethical Testing Guide`](../../guides/developer_guides/ai/AI_Ethical_Testing_Guide.md)).
*   **Security:** Voice parameters are sensitive biometric data; store securely.
