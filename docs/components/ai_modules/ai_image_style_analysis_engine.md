# AI Image Style Analysis Engine

## Purpose
Analyze user-uploaded images (such as profile pictures) to extract visual style parameters (color palettes, brightness, contrast) for integration into UI design and dynamic avatar rendering.

## Expected Inputs
- Image file or URL from user uploads.
- Optional style preferences.

## Processing Logic
- Utilize image processing libraries (e.g., OpenCV, Pillow) to assess image features.
- Map features into style parameters for downstream visualization.
- Ensure transparency and avoid bias.

## Expected Outputs
Example:
```json
{
  "dominant_color": "#34a853",
  "brightness": 70,
  "contrast": 50,
  "saturation": 60
}
```

## Integration
- Provides style parameters to UI modules like the AI Clone Persona Engine.
- Stored and used for enhancing user profile presentation.

## Ethical Considerations
- **Transparency:** Users must be informed about the analysis and its purpose.
- **Consent:** Explicit user consent is required for image analysis.
- **Bias Mitigation:** Ensure algorithms are tested for biases related to image features (e.g., skin tone, cultural artifacts).
- **Security:** Processed data must be stored securely and used only for the stated purpose.
