# UI Component Specification: SecurityStatusIndicator

---

## 1. Introduction and Description

The **SecurityStatusIndicator** is a vital UI component providing users with **real-time, easily understandable awareness of their data security status**. It acts as a persistent visual cue reflecting data encryption state, active protocols, and potential security events, reinforcing **Radical Transparency** and **User Empowerment**.

This component visualizes aspects of the [Security and Privacy Plan](../../architecture/security/security_and_privacy_plan.md) and adheres to the [Style Guide](../../architecture/design/style_guide.md).

## 2. UI Elements / Sub-components

Typically integrated into a persistent header/footer/dashboard.

*   **Real-Time Status Indicators:** Core icon/badge (padlock/shield) using color-coding:
    *   *Green:* Secure state (HTTPS active, DB encrypted).
    *   *Amber/Yellow:* Warning (Potential vulnerability, non-critical issue).
    *   *Red/Neon Orange:* Alert (Active risk, insecure state, breach alert).
    *   Optional subtle animations per state.
*   **Security Protocol Log (On Hover/Click):** Tooltip/Popover showing concise, timestamped list of recent relevant security actions (e.g., "HTTPS Established", "JWT Verified", "Data Encrypted at Rest").
*   **Data Breach Alerts (Integrated):** Overrides indicator to Red + Alert Icon. Triggers separate prominent UI notification (banner/modal) with details and action links.
*   **Link to Security Center:** Small icon (⚙️/ℹ️) linking to the full Security & Privacy Center ([Security Feedback Loops Guide](../../guides/developer_guides/Security_Feedback_Loops.md)).

## 3. Actionable Parameters (User Validation & Awareness)

*   **Data Security Status (Validation):** Allows instant user validation of expected security level (Green). Yellow/Red prompts investigation via logs/settings.
*   **Transparency Validation (Audit):** Protocol Log enables user auditing of applied security measures during workflows.
*   **Risk Awareness (Prompt to Act):** Red status/Breach Alert prompts immediate user action based on accompanying notification.

## 4. Code Implementation Notes

*   **Framework:** React.
*   **State:** Uses global state (Context/Zustand `securityStore`) updated via API (`GET /api/v1/security/status`) or WebSockets (for breach alerts).
*   **Components:** Main `SecurityStatusIndicator`, sub-components `StatusIcon`, `ProtocolLogTooltip`, `BreachAlertNotification`.
*   **API:** Needs backend endpoint for status/logs and WebSocket/push mechanism for alerts.
*   **Validation:** UI trusts backend status but visually verifies it.

## 5. Testing Instructions

*   Test rendering/animation for Green, Yellow, Red states based on mocked status.
*   Test Protocol Log display trigger and content accuracy with mocked log data.
*   Test Breach Alert trigger (mock WebSocket event), visual change, and notification display/link.
*   Test API error handling (e.g., display Yellow "Status unavailable").
*   Test Accessibility (contrast, keyboard interaction, screen reader announcements).
*   Test Responsiveness.

## 6. UI Mockup Placeholder

*   `[Placeholder: Link to SecurityStatusIndicator mockup]`

## 7. Dependencies & Integration

*   **Depends:** Backend Security Status/Log API, Real-time Alert mechanism, Global State (`securityStore`), Style Guide.
*   **Integrates:** Main App Layout, Security & Privacy Center (via link).

## 8. Future Enhancements

*   Granular status indicators, user-configurable alert thresholds, browser security API integration, historical log view.
