# Design Document: Security Status Indicator UI Component

## 1. Introduction and Description

The **Security Status Indicator** is a vital UI component within the ThinkAlike platform, designed to provide users with **real-time, easily understandable awareness of their data security status**. It functions as a persistent visual cue, dynamically reflecting the current state of data encryption (in transit and at rest), the activity of core security protocols, and alerting users to potential security events or vulnerabilities requiring attention.

This component is a cornerstone of ThinkAlike's commitment to **Radical Transparency** and **User Empowerment**. By making security status immediately visible and verifiable, it allows users to confirm that the platform's security measures are active and functioning as expected. It transforms abstract security concepts into tangible feedback, building trust and enabling users to feel more secure and in control of their digital environment. This component directly supports the security measures outlined in the [ThinkAlike Security and Privacy Implementation Plan](../../architecture/security/security_and_privacy_plan.md) and adheres to the visual language defined in the [ThinkAlike Style Guide](../../guides/developer_guides/style_guide.md).

## 2. UI Components / Sub-components

The Security Status Indicator is typically integrated into a persistent part of the UI (such as the main header, footer, or a dedicated status bar) and comprises several key visual elements:

### 2.1 Real-Time Status Indicators

* **Purpose:** Provide immediate, at-a-glance visual feedback on the overall security status of the user's current connection and data handling context.

* **UI Elements:**
  * **Core Icon/Badge:** A primary visual element (e.g., a stylized padlock or shield icon).
  * **Color-Coding:** The icon's background or fill color changes dynamically based on the assessed security level, using the defined palette from the style guide:
    * **Green (`#2ECC71`):** Default state indicating secure protocols are active (e.g., HTTPS connection stable, backend encryption verified).
    * **Amber/Honey Yellow (`#FFC300`):** Warning state indicating potential vulnerabilities or sub-optimal configurations.
    * **Neon Orange/Red (`#FF8C00` or `#FF5733`):** Alert state indicating active security risks or detected threats.
  * **Subtle Animations (Optional):**
    * *Green:* Gentle pulse or static.
    * *Yellow:* Slow, intermittent blink or glow.
    * *Red:* Noticeable, faster pulse or glow to draw attention.

* **Data Source:** Driven by real-time updates fetched from a dedicated backend API endpoint (e.g., `GET /api/security/status`).

### 2.2 Security Protocol Log (Accessible via Indicator Click/Hover)

* **Purpose:** Offer transparency by providing detailed information about the security protocols applied during the session.

* **UI Elements:**
  * **Interaction Trigger:** Activated on hover or click of the Real-Time Status Indicator.
  * **Tooltip/Popover Display:** A non-intrusive overlay appears near the indicator.
  * **Log Content:** Shows a concise, chronological list of recent security protocol events (for example:
    * `[Timestamp] HTTPS (TLS 1.3) Connection Secured`
    * `[Timestamp] API Authentication Verified (JWT)`
    * `[Timestamp] Data Encrypted using AES-256`
    * `[Timestamp] User Permission Check Passed`)

* **Data Source:** Fetched from a backend logging API (e.g., `GET /api/security/logs?context=session&limit=5`).

### 2.3 Data Breach Alerts (Integrated with Indicator)

* **Purpose:** Immediately notify the user in the event of a significant security incident or data breach.

* **UI Elements:**
  * **Urgent Visual Override:** The indicator switches to **Red** and displays an alert icon (e.g., an exclamation mark overlaying the padlock or shield).
  * **Associated Notification:** A prominent notification (such as a persistent banner or modal) details the detected issue.
  * **Clear Call to Action:** The notification includes a brief explanation and an actionable link (e.g., "Review Recent Activity" or "Secure Your Account Now").

* **Trigger:** A backend Security Incident Response system pushes a high-priority notification (via WebSockets) to the user's frontend session.

### 2.4 Link to Security Center / Feedback Loops

* **Purpose:** Connect the immediate status provided by the indicator to comprehensive security settings and logs.

* **UI Elements:** A small settings icon (⚙️) or info icon (ℹ️) near the indicator or within the popover.

* **Action:** Clicking the icon navigates the user to the "Security & Privacy Center" (detailed in [`Security_Feedback_Loops.md`](../../guides/developer_guides/Security_Feedback_Loops.md)).

## 3. Actionable Parameters (User Validation & Awareness)

* **Data Security Status:** Users can validate that the platform is operating under secure conditions (Green status) or notice when it deviates (Yellow/Red).

* **Transparency Validation:** Users can audit specific security measures via the protocol log.

* **Risk Awareness:** A Red status with a breach alert provides an actionable prompt—guiding the user to review details or secure their account.

## 4. Code Implementation Notes

* **Framework:** React.

* **State Management:** Use a global state management solution (e.g., React Context, Zustand, or Redux) to hold security status data (`status`, `logs`, etc.), updated via API calls or WebSocket messages.

* **Component Structure (Conceptual Example):**

```jsx
// Simplified Structure
import React, { useContext } from 'react';
import { SecurityContext } from './path/to/SecurityContext';
import StatusIcon from './StatusIcon'; // Handles icon visuals and animations
import ProtocolLogPopover from './ProtocolLogPopover'; // Displays the log on hover/click
import AlertIcon from './AlertIcon'; // For breach alert notifications
import SettingsLink from './SettingsLink'; // Link to the Security Center

function SecurityStatusIndicator() {
  const { securityStatus, breachAlert } = useContext(SecurityContext);

  return (
    <div className={`security-indicator status-${securityStatus.level}`}>
      <ProtocolLogPopover logData={securityStatus.logs}>
        <StatusIcon level={securityStatus.level} />
        {breachAlert && <AlertIcon severity={breachAlert.severity} />}
      </ProtocolLogPopover>
      <SettingsLink />
    </div>
  );
}

export default SecurityStatusIndicator;
