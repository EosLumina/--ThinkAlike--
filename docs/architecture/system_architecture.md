# ThinkAlike: Architecture of Digital Liberation

## Core Principles Embodied in Architecture

- **User Sovereignty**: All data belongs to users, with clear boundaries and consent
- **Radical Transparency**: System designed for visibility and auditability
- **Decentralized Control**: Avoiding central points of control or failure

## Component Architecture

### Backend (FastAPI)
- Clean separation between API, business logic, and data access
- Explicit consent mechanisms for all data operations
- Transparent data flow with tracing capabilities

### Frontend (React)
- UI as a validation framework - visualizing data sovereignty
- Component architecture mirroring our values
- Clear user control over all data sharing and usage
