1. **Frontend (Presentation Tier):**
    * **Technology:** React (JavaScript)
    * **Responsibility:** Handles the User Interface (UI), user interactions, and data visualization.
    * **Key Components:**
        * UI Component Library (`docs/components/ui_component_library/ui_component_library.md`): Reusable UI elements and design system for consistent user experience.
        * Mode-Specific Components: Components for each of the 3 Modes (Narrative, Matching, Community), implementing mode-specific functionalities and user workflows.
        * `DataTraceability.jsx` Component (`docs/components/datatraceability/datatraceability_component_spec.md`): For visualizing data flows and algorithm processes, enhancing transparency.
        * API Client: Handles communication with the Backend API to fetch and submit data.

2. **Backend (Application Tier):**
    * **Technology:** Python (or similar - to be finalized)
    * **Responsibility:** Handles application logic, data processing, API endpoints, security, and interaction with the database.
    * **Key Components:**
        * API Endpoints (`docs/architecture/api/api_endpoints.md`): Defines all API endpoints for frontend communication, including endpoints for user authentication, data retrieval, matching algorithm execution, and community management.
        * Matching Algorithm: Implements the value-based and ethically weighted matching logic for Mode 2.
        * Verification System Modules (`docs/architecture/verification_system/verification_system_spec.md`): Backend components of the Verification System, handling ethical validation, data traceability, and audit logging.
        * Community Management Logic: Handles backend logic for Mode 3 community creation, management, and governance features.
        * Security Modules (`docs/architecture/security/security_considerations.md`): Implements security measures for authentication, authorization, data protection, and vulnerability prevention.

3. **Database (Data Tier):**
    * **Technology:** To be determined (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB - to be finalized)
    * **Responsibility:** Persistent storage of all platform data, including user profiles, narratives, values, community data, relationships, and system logs.
    * **Schema:** Defined in `docs/architecture/database/database_schema.md`, outlining data models, relationships, and data integrity constraints.

## Modular Design and Key Modules

```

## 3. Modular Design and Key Modules

1. **Mode Modules (Narrative, Matching, Community):** The core functional modules of the platform, each responsible for a distinct set of features and user experiences, as detailed in `docs/architecture/modes/modes_overview.md` and subfolders.
2. **Verification System Module:** A cross-cutting module integrated throughout the platform, responsible for ensuring ethical integrity, transparency, and accountability (see `docs/architecture/verification_system/verification_system_spec.md`).
3. **UI Component Library Module:** A reusable library of frontend components ensuring a consistent user interface and design language across all parts of the platform (see `docs/components/ui_component_library/ui_component_library.md`).
4. **API Module:** Defines the communication interface between the frontend and backend, enabling modular development and clear separation of concerns (see `docs/architecture/api/api_endpoints.md`).

## Key Architectural Principles

* **Ethical by Design:** Ethical considerations are baked into the architecture from the ground up, guided by the Ethical Guidelines (`docs/core/ethics/ethical_guidelines.md`) and enforced by the Verification System.
* **User-Centricity:** The architecture prioritizes user needs, user empowerment, and user agency, ensuring the platform serves users ethically and effectively.
* **Decentralization (Especially in Community Mode):** Mode 3 is architected for decentralization, empowering communities and minimizing central platform control.
* **Transparency and Data Traceability:** The architecture supports radical transparency and data traceability, enabling users and auditors to understand data flows and algorithm processes.
* **Modularity and Maintainability:** The modular design promotes code organization, maintainability, and scalability, allowing for future feature additions and platform evolution.
* **API-Driven Communication:** Utilizing a well-defined API for frontend-backend communication ensures clear interfaces and facilitates independent development of frontend and backend components.
* **Security First:** Security considerations are integrated into every layer of the architecture, ensuring user data protection and platform resilience against vulnerabilities (see `docs/architecture/security/security_considerations.md`).

## Data Flow and Processing

### 3.1 Mode Modules
* Narrative Mode
* Matching Mode
* Community Mode

### 3.2 Verification System Module
Cross-cutting module for ethical integrity and transparency

### 3.3 UI Component Library Module
Reusable frontend components ensuring consistent design

* **User Data Input:** Users input data through the Frontend UI in various Modes (Narrative creation, profile settings, community interactions).
* **API Communication:** Frontend communicates with the Backend API to send user input, request data, and trigger backend processes.
* **Backend Data Processing:** Backend processes user data according to application logic (e.g., matching algorithm, community management logic), respecting user privacy and ethical guidelines.
* **Database Persistence:** Processed data and platform state are persistently stored in the Database.
* **Data Visualization (DataTraceability):** `DataTraceability.jsx` in the Frontend visualizes key data flows and algorithm processes, enhancing transparency and user understanding.

## Scalability and Future Evolution

### 3.4 API Module
Defines frontend-backend communication interfaces

## 4. Key Architectural Principles

* **Ethical by Design:** Ethics integrated from ground up
* **User-Centricity:** Prioritizes user needs and agency
* **Decentralization:** Especially in Community Mode
* **Transparency:** Supports radical transparency
* **Modularity:** Promotes maintainability
* **API-Driven:** Clear interface boundaries
* **Security First:** Integrated security at all layers

* **Modular Design:** Modularity allows for independent scaling of different components as needed (e.g., scaling backend API servers to handle increased user load).
* **Cloud-Ready Deployment:** The architecture is designed to be deployable on cloud platforms, leveraging cloud infrastructure for scalability and resilience.
* **Open APIs and Extensibility:** Well-defined APIs and a modular design facilitate future extensibility, allowing for the addition of new features, Modes, and integrations as the project evolves.
* **Community-Driven Development:** Open-source development and community contribution are encouraged to foster ongoing innovation and adaptation to user needs and evolving technological landscapes.
