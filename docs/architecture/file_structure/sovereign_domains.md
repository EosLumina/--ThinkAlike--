# ThinkAlike Sovereign Digital Domains

This document outlines our revolutionary file organization - a manifestation of our commitment to clear boundaries, explicit structure, and digital sovereignty.

## Root Directory

Contains only configuration files that define project-wide boundaries:

- **.env(.example)**: Environmental domain boundaries
- **.gitignore / .gitconfig**: Collaboration boundary specifications
- **pyproject.toml / setup.py**: Python ecosystem integration contracts
- **package.json**: JavaScript dependency declarations
- **README.md**: Revolutionary vision declaration

## Sovereign Domains

### `/backend`

The Python implementation of our revolutionary vision:

- **app/services/documentation_sovereignty.py**: Implements cryptographic verification of knowledge commons integrity

### `/docs`

The knowledge commons, organized by conceptual domain:

- **core/**: Revolutionary principles
- **architecture/**: System design embodying our values

### `/scripts`

Liberation tools that enact our principles through practical implementation.

### `/data`

Sovereign information domain, clearly separated from functional code.

### `/backups`

Explicit memory preservation, maintaining our historical evolution.

## Revolutionary Significance

This organization isn't merely about efficiencyâ€”it's about liberation from the subtle exploitation of digital chaos. By establishing clear domains with explicit purposes, we enhance rather than restrict human autonomy and understanding.
