# Contributor Recognition & Badges Specification

## Purpose
Celebrate diverse, meaningful contributions with badges and condecorations—no leaderboards, no competition, and no meritocracy.

## Features
* Multiple badge types: Technical, Philosophical, Community, Educational, Revolutionary
* Award logic based on direct, verifiable actions (PRs, reviews, mentoring, documentation, community support)
* Peer nomination and community review for special badges
* Badges shown on contributor profiles, with public badge book
* Opt-in notifications for new badges
* Transparent, documented badge criteria and award logic

## API & Data Model
* `Badge`, `Award`, `Nomination`, `Profile`
* `/badges` (list all badges)
* `/badges/award` (award a badge)
* `/badges/nominate` (nominate a peer)
* `/profile/{user_id}/badges` (view user’s badges)

## UI/UX Notes
* Badges visible on user profiles and in a public badge book
* Nomination and award flows are simple and transparent
* No ranking, no leaderboards, no competitive gamification

## Security/Ethics
* All badge logic and criteria are public and auditable
* No badges for “most hours” or “top contributor”—focus on diversity and impact
* Opt-in for all recognition

## Example User Flow
1. Contributor merges a PR and receives a “Code Architect” badge
2. Another contributor nominates them for a “Community Steward” badge
3. Badges appear on their profile and in the badge book
