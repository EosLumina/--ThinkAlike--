# Pluggable Modes System Specification

## Purpose
Enable anyone to build, share, and connect new “Modes” (feature modules) to the ThinkAlike core, supporting decentralized, participative evolution.

## Features
* Mode manifest: `id`, `name`, `description`, `version`, `author`, `entrypoints`, `permissions`, `dependencies`
* Backend API:
  * `GET /api/modes/registry` – List available/active modes
  * `POST /api/modes/activate` – Enable a mode
  * `POST /api/modes/deactivate` – Disable a mode
* Dynamic router loads mode endpoints at runtime
* Frontend: Dynamic navigation, loads enabled modes, UI contract (React component or route)
* SDK/Template: CLI to scaffold a new mode
* Security/Ethics: All modes declare permissions and pass transparent review
* Registry: Open, community-moderated list of available modes

## API & Data Model
* Mode manifest JSON schema
* Registry database or config file
* Dynamic import and registration logic

## UI/UX Notes
* Modes appear in navigation when enabled
* Users can browse, enable, or disable modes
* Contributors can submit new modes for review

## Security/Ethics
* All modes sandboxed and reviewed for privacy, security, and ethical alignment
* Permissions are explicit and user-controlled

## Example Modes
* Jobs Exchange (time-banking, reviews, scheduling)
* Transport Pooling (ride-sharing, eco-routing)
* UBI Ledger (universal basic income tracking)
* Mutual Aid (resource exchange, trust circles)
