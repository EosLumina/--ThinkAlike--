* Direct democracy (one person, one vote)
* Liquid democracy (delegation, revocable at any time)
* Transparent, auditable decision logs
* AI-assisted, human-in-the-loop moderation
* Community guidelines and ethical checks
* Mutual aid: resource exchange, trust circles, collaborative action tools

## API & Data Model

## UI/UX Notes
