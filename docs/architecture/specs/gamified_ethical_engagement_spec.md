# Gamified, Ethical Engagement Mechanics Specification

## Purpose
Encourage positive, ethical participation and learning through non-competitive, opt-in gamification—never exploitative or addictive.

## Features
* Opt-in quests, challenges, and learning journeys
* Progress tracked by milestones, not points or leaderboards
* Badges and recognition for ethical actions, learning, and collaboration
* No FOMO, streaks, or manipulative mechanics
* All gamification is transparent, auditable, and user-controlled

## API & Data Model
* `Quest`, `Milestone`, `Badge`, `Journey`, `UserProgress`
* `/quests` (list, join, complete)
* `/journeys` (track progress)
* `/badges` (award, view)

## UI/UX Notes
* Quests and journeys are opt-in and can be hidden
* Progress is visualized as milestones, not scores
* All gamification elements are explained and can be disabled

## Security/Ethics
* No dark patterns, no addictive loops
* All participation is voluntary and revocable
* All mechanics are open source and auditable

## Example User Flow
1. User opts in to a “Learning Journey” on ethical AI
2. Completes milestones, receives badges for key actions
3. Can opt out or hide progress at any time
