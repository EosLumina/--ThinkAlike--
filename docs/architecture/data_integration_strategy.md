# Data Integration Strategy

// Add to Section 1 (Introduction / Principles):

* **Value Resonance Focus:** The primary goal is not just finding shared interests (e.g., same band), but identifying potential *value resonance* suggested by shared engagement with specific cultural artifacts or ideas (e.g., shared appreciation for artists focused on social commentary might suggest alignment on 'Social Justice' values). Data transformation logic will aim to map external data to internal Value Nodes or relevant concepts where possible.
* **Data Storytelling:** Transparency tools like the [`Data Explorer Panel`](../../guides/ui_component_specs/data_explorer_panel.md) and [`DataTraceability` component](../../components/ui_components/data_traceability.md) will be designed not just to list harvested data, but to illustrate *how* that data contributes to the user's Value Profile or influences specific recommendations, telling a clear "data story."

// Add new Section 7

## 7. Ongoing Management & Governance

* **Proactive Privacy Checkups & "Data Diet":** The platform will implement periodic, non-intrusive UI prompts encouraging users to review their connected services and data usage settings. Features allowing users to temporarily pause ("Data Diet") data fetching from specific services without full disconnection will be explored to enhance granular control.
* **Community Input on Integrations:** Future integrations beyond the initial Proof of Concept (Goodreads) will ideally be discussed and potentially prioritized with input from the ThinkAlike contributor community (e.g., via Mode 3 forums or GitHub discussions), ensuring new integrations align with collective values and offer genuine utility.
