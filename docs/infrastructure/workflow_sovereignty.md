# Workflow Sovereignty

Unlike conventional CI/CD which often creates hidden dependencies and implicit power structures, ThinkAlike's workflow architecture embodies our core principles:

## Boundary Enforcement
Each workflow explicitly defines its domain boundaries through path filters, ensuring it only acts on relevant components.

## Transparent Processing
All validation steps are explicit and documented, avoiding hidden verification processes.

## User Sovereignty
Clear documentation of workflow responsibilities creates explicit rather than implicit power structures.
