# Project Roadmap: ThinkAlike
Architecting the Foundations for Enlightenment 2.0

## 1. Introduction: The Blueprint for a System Update
This document outlines the planned development direction and major milestones for the ThinkAlike project. It serves as a strategic blueprint, detailing our phased approach to constructing not just a platform, but the foundational catalyst for a necessary civilizational system update towards Enlightenment 2.0, as envisioned in our core Manifesto.

ThinkAlike is conceived as the genesis tool, the initial node in a potential Liberation Technology Ecosystem, designed to function as a Digital Agora – a space fostering conscious self-discovery, authentic connection, reasoned deliberation, and collective action. Its success hinges entirely on communal effort; it is built by the emergent Swarm Intelligence for the Swarm Intelligence. There are no single heroes here; the community itself holds the power to manifest this vision.

This roadmap is a living document, reflecting our commitment to iterative development (System Update Patches) based on progress, ethical reflection, community feedback (Testing Plan), contributor engagement, and strategic alignment with E2.0 principles.

## 2. Guiding Principles: The Architect's Compass
Our development is steered by these core principles:

- Alignment with Enlightenment 2.0: All features, algorithms, and design choices must demonstrably serve the core principles of the Manifesto (Interbeing, Liberation, Otium, Justice, Ecological Harmony, Conscious Evolution).
- Ethical Foundation First: Core ethical principles (Ethical Guidelines) and the Verification System are integral from the start, not afterthoughts. We build on solid moral ground.
- Embodied Collaboration (The Process is the Message): The way we build ThinkAlike must reflect the values we seek to promote – transparency, mutual support (Brotherhood/Fellowship), reasoned discourse, and collective ownership.
- Digital Agora Design: Prioritize features that enable open deliberation, meaningful participation, transparent governance, and the pursuit of Truth/Light.
- User Value & Empowerment: Focus on features that directly enhance user self-discovery, authentic connection, community building, user sovereignty, and control/transparency over their data and experience.
- MVP Focus (Core Bootstrapping): Initial phases concentrate on delivering the Minimum Viable Product (MVP Guide) demonstrating core value propositions (value profiling, basic matching, transparency).
- Iterative & Incremental (System Patches): Deliver functional increments, gather feedback, learn, and adapt. Perfection is approached through refinement.
- Architecting the Ecosystem: View ThinkAlike as the foundational node, designed with future interoperability and integration within a broader E2.0-aligned ecosystem in mind.
- Transparency: Keep this roadmap, our code, and our governance processes open and publicly accessible.

## 3. Current Phase (Example: Q2/Q3 2025 - Post-Initial Setup & Doc Consolidation)
Focus: Establishing core backend/frontend structure (Initial Scaffolding), basic Mode 1 flow (User Onboarding Protocol), foundational UI components (Standardized Building Blocks), initial Verification System concepts (Ethical Kernel Design), and robust documentation baseline (Project Blueprints).

Status:
- Tech Stack Chosen: FastAPI, React (TS planned), PostgreSQL/SQLite, Zustand, Alembic.
- Core Documentation: Initial versions of key documents created/consolidated (Manifesto, Master Ref, Ethics, Onboarding, Arch Overview, API Specs, Component Specs, Guides). index.html functional.
- Basic Infrastructure: Local setup defined (Installation Guide), initial deployment target (Render) identified (Deployment Guide), basic CI/CD for docs likely in place.
- Key Concepts Defined: "UI as Validation", "Ethical Weighting", "Value Profile", "AI Clone" (representing user values).

## 4. Near-Term Goals (Next ~3-6 Months) - "Phase 1: Core OS Bootstrapping & Foundational Code"
Theme 1: Functional MVP - Mode 1 & Basic Profile (User Consciousness Module v0.1)
- Milestone 1.1: Implement Backend API endpoints for User Auth (Register, Login, Token), Basic User Profiles (CRUD via /users/me), and initial Value Profile storage (API Endpoints). Rationale: Establishes secure individual identity within the system.
- Milestone 1.2: Implement Backend API endpoints for Mode 1 Narrative Flow (/narrative/start, /narrative/choice) interacting with a placeholder or simple rule-based Narrative Engine. Store basic narrative progress/choices (API Endpoints Mode 1). Rationale: Initiates the process of value discovery and self-reflection.
- Milestone 1.3: Implement Frontend UI for Authentication (Login/Register forms).
- Milestone 1.4: Implement Frontend UI for basic Mode 1 Narrative interaction (displaying text/choices, sending choices via API).
- Milestone 1.5: Implement basic User Profile viewing/editing UI (UserForm, DataDisplay).

Key Result: Users can register, log in, complete a basic Mode 1 narrative flow for initial value discovery, and manage a rudimentary profile.

Ethical Focus: Secure authentication, basic data privacy, clear UI consent for narrative participation.

Theme 2: Foundational UI Validation & Testing (Quality Assurance Protocols v0.1)
- Milestone 2.1: Implement core UI Validation Components (APIValidator, CoreValuesValidator, basic DataTraceability stub) in the frontend codebase (Component Specs). Rationale: Embeds ethical/functional checks directly into the user experience layer.
- Milestone 2.2: Integrate APIValidator (in dev mode) with core API client calls (Auth, Profile).
- Milestone 2.3: Implement basic Unit Tests (Pytest backend, Jest/RTL frontend) for core auth and profile logic/components. Rationale: Ensures foundational code reliability ("Good Workmanship").
- Milestone 2.4: Set up initial CI pipeline (GitHub Actions) running linters and basic tests.

Key Result: Core "UI as Validation" components exist, basic testing infrastructure is functional, demonstrating commitment to quality.

Theme 3: Documentation & Community Polish (Blueprint Refinement & Lodge Opening v0.1)
- Milestone 3.1: Complete thorough cross-linking and consistency pass across all existing documentation. Update index.html to reflect project purpose.
- Milestone 3.2: Finalize and polish essential guides: Onboarding, Contributing, Installation, Code Style, Ethics. Rationale: Provides clear guidance (Light) for new contributors/builders.
- Milestone 3.3: Establish clear contribution process documentation (Issue templates, PR templates, review guidelines reflecting collaborative ethos) in CONTRIBUTING.md. Add TODO links for communication channels.

Key Result: Documentation is consistent, navigable, and provides clear guidance for new contributors to join the collective build.

## 5. Mid-Term Goals (Next ~6-12 Months) - "Phase 2: Enabling Network Consciousness & Deliberation"
Theme 4: Implementing Mode 2 Discovery & Connection (Weaving the Entangled Web v0.1)
- Milestone 4.1: Implement Backend logic & API for generating Matching Percentages based on Value Profiles (initially rule-based or simple ML, incorporating Ethical Weighting). Endpoint /api/v1/match (POST). (Matching Algorithm Guide). Rationale: Facilitates discovery of resonance and potential connection based on shared values, not superficial traits.
- Milestone 4.2: Implement Backend API endpoints for Mode 2 Discovery (/discovery/network, /discovery/profile/{userId}). (API Endpoints Mode 2).
- Milestone 4.3: Implement Backend logic & API endpoints for Mode 2 Narrative Compatibility Tests (/connection/initiate_test, /connection/test/choice). Requires integration with Narrative Engine. Rationale: Introduces a process for deeper, value-based connection initiation beyond simple matching.
- Milestone 4.4: Implement Frontend UI for Mode 2: browsing User Nodes (AI Clones - basic visualization representing value profiles), viewing detailed profiles, initiating/playing compatibility tests.
- Milestone 4.5: Integrate DataTraceability component to visualize matching rationale in Mode 2. Rationale: Enhances transparency and user understanding of algorithmic processes.

Key Result: Users can discover others based on value alignment and initiate meaningful, gated connections via shared narrative experiences.

Theme 5: Implementing Basic Mode 3 Community Features (Digital Agora Foundations v0.1)
- Milestone 5.1: Implement Backend API endpoints for basic Community CRUD, membership management (join/leave/request), and simple post/comment functionality within a community (API Endpoints Community). Rationale: Provides the initial "space" for collective gathering and discussion.
- Milestone 5.2: Implement Frontend UI for discovering, viewing, joining/requesting to join communities.
- Milestone 5.3: Implement basic Forum UI within a community for viewing/creating posts and comments, designed to encourage reasoned discourse.

Key Result: Users can form and participate in basic, topic-based communities, laying the groundwork for the Digital Agora.

Theme 6: Verification System - Phase 1 (Ethical Kernel v1.0 & Audit Trail)
- Milestone 6.1: Implement core backend infrastructure for the Verification System (Spec). Rationale: Builds the engine for ensuring ongoing alignment with E2.0.
- Milestone 6.2: Implement robust Audit Logging API endpoint (/verification/audit-logs) and integrate logging for key events (auth, profile changes, matching runs, connection attempts, community actions). (VS Data Models). Rationale: Establishes transparency and accountability.
- Milestone 6.3: Implement simple rule-based ethical checks via VS API (e.g., content policy checks for profiles/posts, checks for manipulative patterns, triggered via POST /verification/validate/...). Integrate CoreValuesValidator UI component more deeply. Rationale: Active enforcement of core ethical boundaries.

Key Result: Foundational Verification System is operational for comprehensive audit logging and initial automated ethical rule checks, acting as the system's conscience.
