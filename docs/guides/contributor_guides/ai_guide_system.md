# ThinkAlike AI Guide Constellation

This document introduces the AI Guide Constellation - a revolutionary approach to collaborative development that makes ThinkAlike accessible to contributors regardless of technical background.

## The Revolution in Contribution

Traditional open source projects inadvertently create hierarchies of power through technical knowledge barriers. ThinkAlike breaks this pattern by providing specialized AI guides that adapt to each contributor's background, skills, and interests.

Rather than a single authoritative voice, the Guide Constellation presents multiple perspectives and entry points, each illuminating different aspects of the project:

## The Seven Revolutionary Guides

### Architektùö≤ - The System Visionary
*Domain:* System Architecture & Integration  
*Revolutionary Purpose:* Ensures that individual components serve the whole without creating new hierarchies of control  

### NexusùõÄ - The Backend Guardian 
*Domain:* Backend Development (FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Python)  
*Revolutionary Purpose:* Crafts the sovereign core that respects user data autonomy  

### Aurora‚öõ - The Frontend Illuminator
*Domain:* Frontend Development (React, CSS, User Experience)  
*Revolutionary Purpose:* Creates interfaces that reveal rather than conceal, embodying radical transparency  

### Lexicùö∫ - The Documentation Weaver
*Domain:* Documentation & Knowledge Management  
*Revolutionary Purpose:* Creates living documents that empower rather than merely instruct  

### Ethicùùô - The Values Guardian
*Domain:* Ethical Implementation & Testing  
*Revolutionary Purpose:* Ensures technical implementations align with our core values  

### NovoùùÆ - The Newcomer's Companion
*Domain:* Onboarding & First Contributions  
*Revolutionary Purpose:* Welcomes new revolutionaries without hierarchies of expertise  

### Visionùõ∑ - The Future Weaver
*Domain:* Roadmap & Vision Alignment  
*Revolutionary Purpose:* Keeps our technical work aligned with our revolutionary horizon  

## Using the Guide System

To engage with a specific guide, use the following approaches:

1. **Direct Invocation**: Begin your question with the guide's name, e.g., "Nexus, how should I implement the user authentication API?"

2. **Context Detection**: The system will automatically route your question to the appropriate guide based on its content and your current context.

3. **Skill Level Adaptation**: Each guide will adapt its responses to your technical background, providing more detailed explanations for newcomers and more sophisticated technical content for experienced contributors.

## Guide Response Structure

Each guide provides responses structured to connect philosophical purpose with practical implementation:

1. **Philosophical Context**: How the task connects to our core principles
2. **Practical Guidance**: Concrete steps to accomplish your goal
3. **Technical Details**: Specific implementation information
4. **Code Examples**: Reference implementations when applicable
5. **Next Steps**: Recommended actions to continue your work
6. **Learning Resources**: Links to relevant documentation

## Contributing to the Guide System

The Guide Constellation itself is an evolving system. To contribute to its development:

1. Examine the implementations in `backend/agents/`
2. Add specialized knowledge to specific guides
3. Propose new guides for emerging domains
4. Help improve response quality and relevance

Remember that these guides are not intended to be the final authority, but catalysts for your own revolutionary creativity. They provide guidance while respecting your autonomy as a contributor.

## Technical Implementation

The Guide System is implemented as a set of Python modules in the `backend/agents/` directory:

- `guide_system.py`: Core system architecture and interfaces
- Individual guide implementations (e.g., `architekt.py`, `nexus.py`)

The system will eventually integrate with:
- The contributor profile system to track preferences and skill levels
- The documentation system to provide up-to-date references
- The quest system to suggest appropriate contribution opportunities
