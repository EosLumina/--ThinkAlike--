# Code Review Guidelines

---

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines ThinkAlike's code review standards and best practices. Effective code reviews improve code quality, 
reduce bugs, share knowledge across the team, and ensure consistency in our codebase. These guidelines provide a framework 
for constructive, efficient, and respectful code review processes.

---

## 2. Core Principles

### 2.1 Purpose of Code Reviews

Code reviews at ThinkAlike serve multiple purposes:

* **Quality Assurance**: Catch bugs, logic errors, and edge cases early

* **Knowledge Sharing**: Spread expertise and context across the team

* **Consistency**: Ensure codebase follows established patterns and standards

* **Mentorship**: Provide learning opportunities for all team members

* **Collective Ownership**: Build shared responsibility for the codebase

### 2.2 Review Mindset

Approach code reviews with the following mindset:

* **Be Respectful**: All feedback should be constructive and professional

* **Focus on Code, Not People**: Review the code, not the coder

* **Assume Good Intent**: Assume teammates are doing their best work

* **Be Humble**: Everyone has something to learn, regardless of experience level

* **Consider Context**: Understand the purpose, constraints, and urgency of changes

* **Remember the Human**: The code author has feelings and perspective

---

## 3. Code Review Process

### 3.1 When to Request a Review

* After passing all automated tests

* After performing a self-review

* When the code is ready for production (not for early feedback)

* For all changes to the main codebase, regardless of size

### 3.2 Pull Request Preparation

Before requesting a review, ensure your pull request includes:

* **Clear Title**: Concise description of what the change accomplishes

* **Description**: Context, reasoning, and summary of changes

* **Linked Issues**: References to any related tickets or issues

* **Testing Details**: How the changes were tested, and how reviewers can test

* **Screenshots/Videos**: For UI changes, before/after visuals

* **Necessary Labels**: Priority, type of change, affected components

* **Self-review Checklist**: Confirmation of meeting standards

Example pull request template:

```markdown

### 3.3 Reviewing Code

When reviewing code, follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Context**: Read the PR description and linked issues
2. **Run the Code**: If possible, check out the branch and test the changes
3. **Review Tests**: Examine test coverage and test quality
4. **Review Implementation**: Evaluate the code itself
5. **Provide Feedback**: Comment on issues and suggest improvements
6. **Summarize**: Provide an overall assessment at the end

### 3.4 Response Time Expectations

* **Initial Review**: Within 1 business day

* **Follow-up Reviews**: Within 4 business hours

* **Urgent PRs**: Marked as such and addressed within 4 business hours

* **Long-running PRs**: Check in daily on PRs taking multiple days

### 3.5 Resolving Disagreements

When reviewers and authors disagree:

1. **Clarify Understanding**: Ensure both sides understand the issue
2. **Consider Alternatives**: Explore multiple approaches
3. **Involve Others**: Seek input from additional team members
4. **Defer to Principles**: Reference architectural or design principles
5. **Escalate When Needed**: If unresolved, involve a technical lead

* **Extensibility**: Can the code be extended without major changes?

* **Reusability**: Could parts of this code be reused elsewhere?

---

## 5. Providing Feedback

### 5.1 Comment Types

Use different comment types to communicate effectively:

* **Questions**: Ask for clarification or rationale

* **Suggestions**: Propose alternatives or improvements

* **Issues**: Point out problems that should be fixed

* **Praise**: Acknowledge good solutions or practices

* **Nits**: Minor style or readability suggestions

### 5.2 Comment Structure

Structure comments to be clear and actionable:

* **Be Specific**: Reference exact lines or sections

* **Explain Why**: Provide reasoning behind feedback

* **Offer Solutions**: When possible, suggest concrete improvements

* **Prioritize Issues**: Distinguish between major and minor concerns

* **Use Markdown**: Format comments for readability

### 5.3 Constructive Language

Use language that encourages collaboration:

| Instead of | Try |
|------------|-----|
| "Why did you do this?" | "Can you explain the reasoning behind this approach?" |
| "This is wrong." | "I think there might be an issue here because..." |
| "You forgot to..." | "We should add..." |
| "This code is messy." | "This section could be more maintainable by..." |
| "Never do this." | "Generally, we prefer to..." |

### 5.4 Feedback Examples

Examples of constructive feedback:

#### Positive Feedback

```text
Great job implementing the caching strategy here. The TTL settings make sense for this use case, and I like how you added clear invalidation logic.
```

#### Question

```text
I'm curious about the choice to use a HashMap here instead of a TreeMap. Was performance the main consideration, or are there other benefits I'm missing?
```

#### Suggestion

```text
This loop could potentially be simplified using streams:

```java
return users.stream()
    .filter(User::isActive)
    .map(User::getEmail)
    .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

It might make the intent clearer, but I'll leave it up to you if you prefer this approach.
```

#### Issue

```text
This query doesn't include an index for the `status` field, which could cause performance issues with large datasets. We should either add an index or restructure the query to use existing indexes.
```

#### Nitpick

```text
nit: we typically use camelCase for variable names rather than snake_case to match our style guide.
```

## 6. Responding to Feedback

### 6.1 As a Code Author

When receiving feedback:

* **Be Open**: Approach feedback as an opportunity to improve

* **Ask Questions**: Seek clarification if feedback is unclear

* **Explain Decisions**: Share context for your choices

* **Make Requested Changes**: Address valid concerns

* **Discuss Alternatives**: If you disagree, suggest different solutions

* **Express Gratitude**: Thank reviewers for their time and input

### 6.2 Common Responses

Examples of constructive responses to feedback:

#### Accepting Feedback

```text
Great catch! I've updated the code to handle this edge case.
```

#### Asking for Clarification

```text
I'm not sure I understand the concern about the database query. Could you elaborate on what might go wrong in a high-load scenario?
```

#### Explaining a Decision

```text
I chose this approach because it allows for easier extension when we implement the planned feature X next quarter. Alternative approaches would require more significant refactoring later.
```

#### Suggesting an Alternative

```text
I see your point about the potential memory issue. Instead of implementing your suggested approach with a cache, what if we switched to a streaming process that would keep memory usage constant?
```
