# UI Accessibility Guide

## Purpose

This guide ensures that ThinkAlike's UI components are accessible to all users, including those with disabilities,
aligning with WCAG 2.1 standards.

## Accessibility Principles

1. **Perceivable:** Information and UI components must be presented in ways users can perceive.
2. **Operable:** UI components must be usable via keyboard and assistive technologies.
3. **Understandable:** Information and operations must be easy to understand.
4. **Robust:** Content must be compatible with current and future assistive technologies.

## Best Practices

* **Keyboard Navigation:** Ensure all UI components are navigable via keyboard.

* **ARIA Roles:** Use ARIA attributes to enhance screen reader compatibility.
* **Contrast Ratios:** Maintain a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for text.

* **Responsive Design:** Ensure components adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.

## Testing

* **Automated Tools:** Use tools like Axe or Lighthouse for accessibility audits.

* **Manual Testing:** Test with screen readers (e.g., NVDA, JAWS) and keyboard navigation.
* **User Feedback:** Incorporate feedback from users with disabilities.

## Integration

* **UI Components:** Accessibility features are integrated into reusable components.

* **Continuous Monitoring:** Regular audits to ensure ongoing compliance.
