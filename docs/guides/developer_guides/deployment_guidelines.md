# Deployment Guidelines

---

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the deployment standards and practices for the ThinkAlike project. Following these guidelines ensures consistent, reliable, and secure deployments across all environments. These practices apply to all components of the ThinkAlike platform, including backend services, frontend applications, and supporting infrastructure.

---

## 2. Deployment Environments

ThinkAlike uses multiple environments to ensure quality and stability:

### 2.1 Environment Types

* **Development (dev)**: For individual developers to test changes

  * Ephemeral environments, often local or per-developer cloud instances

  * May use mock services for external dependencies

  * Non-critical data, can be reset as needed

* **Testing/QA**: For thorough testing of changes before staging

  * Shared environment for QA team

  * Integrated with automated testing

  * Refreshed with anonymized production data periodically

* **Staging**: Production-like environment for final verification

  * Mirrors production configuration

  * Used for UAT (User Acceptance Testing)

  * Final testing ground for deployment processes

  * Regular data sync with production (anonymized if necessary)

* **Production**: Live environment serving real users

  * Highest security, stability, and performance requirements

  * Strict access controls

  * Comprehensive monitoring and alerting

### 2.2 Environment Configuration

* Use environment variables for configuration

* Store secrets in secure services (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault)

* Document required configuration for each environment

* Maintain parity between environments where possible

```

# Example environment variable schema

# .env.example (Do not include actual values in version control)

# App Configuration

APP_ENV=development|testing|staging|production
APP_DEBUG=true|false
APP_PORT=3000

# Database Configuration

DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=thinkalike
DB_USER=dbuser
DB_PASSWORD=secretpassword

# API Configuration

API_TIMEOUT_MS=5000
API_RATE_LIMIT=100

# Authentication

AUTH_SECRET_KEY=secret
AUTH_TOKEN_EXPIRY=86400

# External Services

ML_SERVICE_URL=http://ml-service:8080
ANALYTICS_API_KEY=apikey

```

---

## 3. Containerization

ThinkAlike services are containerized using Docker for consistency across environments:

### 3.1 Docker Best Practices

* Use specific version tags for base images, not `latest`

* Implement multi-stage builds to minimize image size

* Include only necessary files in the container

* Run containers as non-root users

* Set appropriate resource limits

* Scan images for vulnerabilities before deployment

### 3.2 Example Dockerfile (Backend)

```dockerfile

# Build stage

FROM python:3.10-slim AS builder

WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies

COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip wheel --no-cache-dir --no-deps --wheel-dir /app/wheels -r requirements.txt

# Runtime stage

FROM python:3.10-slim

# Create non-root user

RUN groupadd -g 1001 appuser && \
    useradd -r -u 1001 -g appuser appuser

WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies

COPY --from=builder /app/wheels /wheels
COPY --from=builder /app/requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache /wheels/*

# Copy application code

COPY ./app ./app

# Set permissions

RUN chown -R appuser:appuser /app
USER appuser

# Configure environment

EXPOSE 8000
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1

# Run the application

CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]

```

### 3.3 Example Docker Compose

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  api:
    build:
      context: ./backend
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:

      * "8000:8000"
    environment:

      * DB_HOST=db

      * DB_PORT=5432

      * DB_NAME=thinkalike

      * DB_USER=${DB_USER}

      * DB_PASSWORD=${DB_PASSWORD}
    depends_on:

      * db
    restart: unless-stopped
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8000/health"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3

  frontend:
    build: ./frontend
    ports:

      * "3000:80"
    depends_on:

      * api
    restart: unless-stopped

  db:
    image: postgres:14-alpine
    volumes:

      * postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    environment:

      * POSTGRES_USER=${DB_USER}

      * POSTGRES_PASSWORD=${DB_PASSWORD}

      * POSTGRES_DB=thinkalike
    restart: unless-stopped
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "pg_isready", "-U", "${DB_USER}"]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5

volumes:
  postgres_data:

```

## 4. CI/CD Pipeline

ThinkAlike uses automated CI/CD pipelines for consistent and reliable deployments:

### 4.1 Pipeline Components

* **Continuous Integration (CI)**

  * Code linting and style checks

  * Unit and integration testing

  * Security vulnerability scanning

  * Build artifacts (Docker images, etc.)

* **Continuous Deployment (CD)**

  * Automated deployment to appropriate environments

  * Post-deployment testing

  * Rollback capability if issues detected

### 4.2 Example GitHub Actions Workflow

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, develop ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:

      * uses: actions/checkout@v3

      * name: Set up Python

      * name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt
          pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

      * name: Lint with flake8
        run: flake8 . --count --select=E9,F63,F7,F82 --show-source --statistics

      * name: Test with pytest

          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}

      * name: Build and push
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v4
        with:
          context: .
          push: true
          tags: thinkalike/api:${{ github.sha }},thinkalike/api:latest

        with:
          host: ${{ secrets.STAGING_HOST }}
          username: ${{ secrets.STAGING_USERNAME }}
          key: ${{ secrets.STAGING_SSH_KEY }}
          script: |

            cd /opt/thinkalike
            docker-compose pull
            docker-compose up -d

```

## 5. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

ThinkAlike uses Infrastructure as Code to manage and provision resources:

### 5.1 Terraform Configuration

All cloud resources are defined and managed using Terraform:

```hcl

# Example Terraform configuration for AWS resources

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

module "vpc" {
  source = "terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws"
  version = "3.14.0"

  name = "thinkalike-${var.environment}"
  cidr = "10.0.0.0/16"

  azs             = ["us-west-2a", "us-west-2b", "us-west-2c"]
  private_subnets = ["10.0.1.0/24", "10.0.2.0/24", "10.0.3.0/24"]
  public_subnets  = ["10.0.101.0/24", "10.0.102.0/24", "10.0.103.0/24"]

  enable_nat_gateway = true
  single_nat_gateway = var.environment != "production"

  tags = {
    Environment = var.environment
    Project     = "thinkalike"
    ManagedBy   = "terraform"
  }
}

module "ecs" {
  source = "terraform-aws-modules/ecs/aws"
  version = "3.5.0"

  name = "thinkalike-${var.environment}"

  container_insights = var.environment == "production"

  capacity_providers = ["FARGATE", "FARGATE_SPOT"]
  default_capacity_provider_strategy = [
    {
      capacity_provider = var.environment == "production" ? "FARGATE" : "FARGATE_SPOT"
      weight            = 1
    }
  ]

  tags = {
    Environment = var.environment
    Project     = "thinkalike"
    ManagedBy   = "terraform"
  }
}

# Additional resources like RDS, Elasticache, etc.

```

### 5.2 IaC Best Practices

* Store IaC in version control

* Use modules for reusable components

* Implement state locking for collaborative environments

* Use remote state storage (e.g., S3 with DynamoDB)

* Separate state files by environment

* Include documentation within code

* Review IaC changes like regular code

---

## 6. Deployment Strategies

### 6.1 Available Strategies

ThinkAlike uses different deployment strategies depending on the context:

* **Blue/Green Deployment**

  * Two identical environments: "Blue" (current) and "Green" (new)

  * Deploy to Green, test, then switch traffic from Blue to Green

  * Enables quick rollback by switching back to Blue

  * Used for major releases with significant changes

* **Canary Deployment**

  * Gradual rollout to a subset of users/servers

  * Monitor for issues before full deployment

  * Used for features with uncertain impact or performance implications

* **Rolling Deployment**

  * Update instances incrementally in small batches

  * Ensures service availability during deployment

  * Standard approach for routine updates

### 6.2 Strategy Selection Criteria

Choose deployment strategies based on:

* Risk level of the change

* Impact of potential issues

* Urgency of the deployment

* Availability requirements

* Environment (staging vs production)

---

## 7. Database Migrations

### 7.1 Migration Principles

* **Versioned**: All database changes should be versioned

* **Automated**: Migrations should run automatically during deployment

* **Incremental**: Each migration should be small and focused

* **Backward Compatible**: Database changes should not break previous versions

* **Idempotent**: Safe to run multiple times

### 7.2 Migration Process

```python

# Example migration using Alembic for Python/SQLAlchemy

"""add user preferences table

Revision ID: a1b2c3d4e5f6
Revises: g7h8i9j0k1l2
Create Date: 2023-01-15 10:30:00.000000

"""
from alembic import op
import sqlalchemy as sa

# revision identifiers

revision = 'a1b2c3d4e5f6'
down_revision = 'g7h8i9j0k1l2'

def upgrade():
    op.create_table(
        'user_preferences',
        sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), nullable=False),
        sa.Column('user_id', sa.Integer(), nullable=False),
        sa.Column('preference_key', sa.String(255), nullable=False),
        sa.Column('preference_value', sa.Text(), nullable=True),
        sa.Column('created_at', sa.DateTime(), server_default=sa.func.now()),
        sa.Column('updated_at', sa.DateTime(), server_default=sa.func.now(), onupdate=sa.func.now()),
        sa.PrimaryKeyConstraint('id'),
        sa.ForeignKeyConstraint(['user_id'], ['users.id'], ondelete='CASCADE'),
        sa.UniqueConstraint('user_id', 'preference_key', name='uq_user_preference')
    )
    op.create_index(op.f('ix_user_preferences_user_id'), 'user_preferences', ['user_id'])

def downgrade():
    op.drop_index(op.f('ix_user_preferences_user_id'), table_name='user_preferences')
    op.drop_table('user_preferences')

```

### 7.3 Database Migration Guidelines

* Test migrations thoroughly in development and staging

* Include rollback procedures for all migrations

* Consider performance impact for large tables

* Schedule complex migrations during off-peak hours

* Back up the database before applying migrations in production

---

## 8. Monitoring and Observability

### 8.1 Monitoring Components

* **Application Performance Monitoring (APM)**

  * Response times

  * Error rates

  * Throughput

* **Infrastructure Monitoring**

  * CPU, memory, disk usage

  * Network traffic

  * Container health

* **Log Management**

  * Centralized logging

  * Log search and visualization

  * Retention policies

* **Alerting**

  * Alert thresholds

  * On-call rotations

  * Escalation procedures

### 8.2 Observability Stack

ThinkAlike uses the following observability tools:

* Prometheus for metrics collection

* Grafana for visualization

* ELK Stack for log aggregation

* PagerDuty for alerting and on-call management

```yaml

# Example Prometheus configuration

global:
  scrape_interval: 15s
  evaluation_interval: 15s

scrape_configs:

  * job_name: 'api'
    metrics_path: '/metrics'
    static_configs:

      * targets: ['api:8000']

  * job_name: 'node-exporter'
    static_configs:

      * targets: ['node-exporter:9100']

alerting:
  alertmanagers:

    * static_configs:

      * targets:

        * 'alertmanager:9093'

rule_files:

  * "/etc/prometheus/rules/*.rules"

```

---

## 9. Rollback Procedures

### 9.1 Automated Rollbacks

Configure automated rollbacks based on health checks:

```yaml

# Example Kubernetes rollout strategy

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: thinkalike-api
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: thinkalike-api
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 1
      maxUnavailable: 0
  minReadySeconds: 30
  revisionHistoryLimit: 5
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: thinkalike-api
    spec:
      containers:

      * name: api
        image: thinkalike/api:latest
        ports:

        * containerPort: 8000
        livenessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /health
            port: 8000
          initialDelaySeconds: 30
          periodSeconds: 10
        readinessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /ready
            port: 8000
          initialDelaySeconds: 5
          periodSeconds: 5

```

### 9.2 Manual Rollback Procedures

For situations requiring manual rollback:

1. **Identify the Problem**: Confirm that a rollback is necessary
2. **Communicate**: Notify team members about the rollback
3. **Execute Rollback**: Deploy the previous known-good version

   ```bash
   # Example rollback command for Docker Compose

   docker-compose down
   git checkout v1.2.3  # Previous stable version

   docker-compose build
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **Verify**: Confirm that the rollback resolves the issue
5. **Root Cause Analysis**: Investigate what went wrong
6. **Document**: Record the incident and resolution

---

## 10. Security Considerations

### 10.1 Deployment Security Checklist

* Scan container images for vulnerabilities

* Implement network security controls

* Rotate secrets regularly

* Use least-privilege accounts for deployments

* Implement audit logging for all deployment actions

* Enable encryption for data in transit and at rest

* Configure Web Application Firewall (WAF) protection

### 10.2 Secret Management

* Use a dedicated secret management solution

* Never commit secrets to version control

* Rotate secrets regularly

* Implement access controls for secrets

```yaml

# Example Vault configuration for secret management

api_version: 1

auth:
  method: kubernetes
  mount_path: auth/kubernetes
  config:
    role: "api-role"

secrets:

* name: SECRET_KEY
  path: secret/data/thinkalike/api
  key: secret_key

* name: DB_PASSWORD
  path: secret/data/thinkalike/db
  key: password

* name: API_TOKENS
  path: secret/data/thinkalike/integrations
  key: api_tokens

```
