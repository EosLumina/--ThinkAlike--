# Markdown Style Guide

This guide outlines ThinkAlike's standards for writing markdown documents. Following these practices ensures consistency
across our documentation and improves readability.

## Basic Principles

* Use markdown for all documentation when possible
* Aim for clarity and readability over clever formatting
* Follow a consistent structure and formatting

## General Formatting

### Document Structure

* Start each document with a level-1 heading (`# Document Title`)
* Use heading levels sequentially without skipping (e.g., don't jump from `##` to `####`)
* Include a blank line before and after each heading
* End the file with a single blank line

### Line Length

* Limit lines to 120 characters maximum
* Exception: URLs, tables, and code blocks can exceed this limit if necessary
* Break long paragraphs at natural sentence boundaries

### Blank Lines

* Use a single blank line between paragraphs
* Include a blank line before and after:
  * Headings
  * Lists
  * Code blocks
  * Blockquotes
  * Tables
* Never use more than one consecutive blank line

### Indentation

* Use spaces, not tabs, for indentation
* Use 2-space indentation for nested lists and continuations

## Specific Elements

### Lists

* Add a blank line before and after lists
* Use consistent list markers:
  * Unordered lists: Use asterisks (`*`) consistently
  * Ordered lists: Use incremental numbers (`1.`, `2.`, `3.`, etc.)
* Use proper indentation for nested list items

### Code Blocks

* Prefer fenced code blocks (
