# Ethical Ai Implementation Guide

This guide provides specific instructions and best practices for implementing Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) components within ThinkAlike, ensuring strict adherence to our [`Ethical Guidelines`](../../../core/ethics/ethical_guidelines.md). It complements the [`AI Model Development Guide`](./ai_model_development_guide.md) and [`AI Transparency Log`](./ai_transparency_log.md).

Building ethical AI is paramount. All AI/ML development must prioritize user well-being, fairness, transparency, and accountability.

## Core Principles for AI Implementation

1. **Human-Centricity:** AI should augment user understanding and connection, not manipulate or dictate outcomes. Users remain the focus.
2. **Transparency & Explainability:** Users and developers must be able to understand *how* AI influences results (within practical limits). Use techniques that support explainability and meticulously log decisions ([`AI Transparency Log`](./ai_transparency_log.md)).
3. **Fairness & Bias Mitigation:** Actively identify and mitigate potential biases (demographic, cognitive, etc.) in data, algorithms, and evaluation metrics. See Guideline 4.
4. **Privacy Preservation:** AI models must be trained and operated using techniques that minimize exposure of sensitive user data. Adhere strictly to the [`Data Handling Policy`](../data_handling_policy_guide.md).
5. **Accountability & Oversight:** Establish clear ownership for AI models, processes for auditing their behavior, and mechanisms for addressing issues. The Verification System plays a role here.
6. **User Control:** Provide users with meaningful controls over how AI affects their experience (e.g., adjusting matching preferences, understanding profile generation).

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Data Handling for AI

* **Consent:** Only use user data for AI training/inference if explicit, granular consent has been obtained for that specific purpose (Guideline 2.a). Consent flags must be checked *before* data is fed into AI pipelines.
* **Anonymization/Pseudonymization:** Apply strong anonymization or pseudonymization techniques to training data wherever possible, especially if sharing data or using third-party tools. Document the techniques used.
* **Data Minimization:** Only collect and use the minimum data necessary for the AI task (Guideline 3.a). Avoid collecting sensitive attributes unless absolutely essential and ethically justified.
* **Secure Storage & Access:** Store AI training data and models securely, applying the same access controls and encryption standards as other sensitive data ([`Security Deep Dive`](../../../architecture/security_deep_dive.md)).

### 2. Model Development & Training ([`AI Model Development Guide`](./ai_model_development_guide.md))

* **Bias Assessment:** Before and during training, rigorously analyze datasets for potential biases. Use tools and techniques (e.g., fairness metrics, subgroup analysis) to measure bias. Document findings.
* **Mitigation Strategies:** Employ bias mitigation techniques (e.g., data augmentation, re-weighting, algorithmic adjustments like adversarial debiasing) as needed. Document the chosen strategies and their effectiveness.
* **Model Selection:** Favor models known for better interpretability (e.g., LIME, SHAP applicable models) where feasible without significant performance loss for the specific task. Document the rationale for model choice.
* **Evaluation Metrics:** Use a *suite* of evaluation metrics, including standard performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall) AND fairness metrics (e.g., demographic parity, equal opportunity). Define acceptable thresholds for both.
* **Ethical Review:** Incorporate an ethical review checkpoint before deploying significant AI model changes. This could involve a dedicated ethics council or checklist review process.

### 3. AI Inference & Integration

* **Transparency Logging ([`AI Transparency Log`](./ai_transparency_log.md)):**
  * For every significant AI-driven decision affecting a user (e.g., profile generation element, match suggestion), log:
    * Input data/features used (or hashes/references).
    * Model version used.
    * The output/decision.
    * Confidence score (if applicable).
    * Explainability data (e.g., key features contributing to the decision, SHAP values).
  * This log must be accessible for generating user-facing explanations via the `DataTraceability` component and for internal auditing.
* **Verification System Hooks:** Integrate AI components with the [`Verification System`](../../../architecture/verification_system/verification_system_deep_dive.md):
  * *Pre-check:* Verify input data conforms to expected formats and potentially basic ethical constraints before feeding to the model.
  * *Post-check:* Verify AI outputs against defined constraints (e.g., ensure generated profile text doesn't violate content policies, check match suggestions against user blocks/preferences).
* **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL):** For highly sensitive decisions or low-confidence predictions, consider implementing HITL workflows where a human reviews or confirms the AI suggestion before it affects the user.
* **User Controls:** Design interfaces that allow users to:
  * Understand *that* AI is being used.
  * See *why* a particular suggestion was made (leveraging transparency logs).
  * Adjust parameters influencing AI behavior (e.g., matching strictness, topic preferences).
  * Provide feedback on AI suggestions ([`Security Feedback Loops`](../security_feedback_loops.md) can be adapted).

### 4. Example: Ethical Matching Algorithm Implementation

*(Conceptual Pseudocode/Steps)*

1. **Trigger:** User requests profile matches (Mode 2).
2. **Consent Check (Service Layer):** Verify user has consented to profile matching (`has_consent(user_id, 'consent_profile_matching_v1')`). **Block if no consent.**
3. **Fetch User Profile (Service Layer):** Retrieve user's `value_profile_summary` and `interests_vector` (only consented fields).
4. **Pre-Verification (Verification System):** Call `VerificationAPI.verify_matching_preconditions(user_id, parameters)` to check user status, parameter validity, etc.
5. **Candidate Selection (Matching Service):** Query database/index for potential candidates based on coarse criteria (e.g., activity status, basic filters). Anonymize candidate data retrieved.
6. **AI Scoring (Matching Service):**
    * For each candidate, calculate compatibility score using the trained matching model (`matching_model_v1.3.predict(user_vector, candidate_vector)`).
    * **Log Input/Output:** Log user vector ref, candidate vector ref, model version, raw score to [`AI Transparency Log`](./ai_transparency_log.md).
    * **Get Explainability:** Generate explanation data (e.g., key dimensions contributing to score) using LIME/SHAP applied to the model. Log this.
7. **Post-Verification & Filtering (Verification System):** Call `VerificationAPI.verify_match_results(user_id, candidate_id, raw_score)` for each potential match. This checks:
    * Mutual blocking status.
    * User-defined exclusion criteria.
    * Ethical constraints on matching (e.g., prevent echo chamber extremes if designed).
    * Score threshold checks.
    * **Filter results based on Verification output.**
8. **Format Results (Service Layer):** Prepare the final list of anonymized candidate snippets and associated (potentially simplified) explanations derived from the transparency log.
9. **Return to Frontend:** Send the verified and formatted list.
10. **Frontend Display:** Use `DataTraceability` component (potentially simplified) to allow users to optionally see *why* a match was suggested.

## Maintaining Ethical AI

* **Monitoring:** Continuously monitor AI model performance *and* fairness metrics in production. Set up alerts for significant drifts or degradation.
* **Regular Audits:** Perform periodic audits of AI components against these guidelines, reviewing transparency logs, fairness metrics, and user feedback.
* **Model Retraining & Updates:** Follow the full ethical development cycle (bias assessment, mitigation, testing) when retraining or updating models. Version models carefully.
* **Feedback Loops:** Actively solicit and analyze user feedback regarding AI-driven features.

Implementing AI ethically is an ongoing commitment requiring vigilance and adherence to these guidelines throughout the entire lifecycle.

# Guide: Building a UI Component in ThinkAlike

This guide outlines the process and best practices for creating new UI components for the ThinkAlike frontend (React/TypeScript). It emphasizes consistency, testability, and integration with our core principles, including the "UI as Validation Framework."

**Prerequisites:**

* Familiarity with React, TypeScript, CSS Modules (or the project's styling solution).
* Understanding of the project's [`Code Style Guide`](./code_style_guide.md) (Frontend section).
* Awareness of the "UI as Validation Framework" ([`Core Concepts Explained`](../../vision/core_concepts.md), [`UI Validation Examples`](./ui_validation_examples.md)).

## 1. Planning & Design

* **Define Purpose:** Clearly state what the component does and why it's needed. Is it purely presentational, interactive, data-fetching, or a combination?
* **Define Props (API):** Specify the component's interface. What data does it need? What configuration options? What callback functions (e.g., `onClick`, `onChange`, `onSubmit`)? Use TypeScript interfaces for strong typing.
* **Define State:** Identify the internal state the component needs to manage (`useState`). Keep state minimal and lift it up when necessary.
* **Visual Design:** How should it look? Refer to general style guides or existing component patterns.
* **Accessibility (a11y):** Consider accessibility from the start. Use semantic HTML, ARIA attributes where appropriate, ensure keyboard navigability and screen reader compatibility.
* **Validation Integration:** Does this component handle user input requiring ethical checks? Does it display sensitive data needing traceability? Does it trigger API calls needing schema validation? Identify which validation components (`CoreValuesValidator`, `APIValidator`, `DataTraceability`) need to be integrated.
* **Documentation (Optional but Recommended):** For reusable or complex components, consider creating a basic spec document in `docs/components/ui_components/` outlining its purpose and props.

## 2. File Structure

Create a dedicated folder for your component within `frontend/src/components/` (or a relevant sub-directory):

frontend/src/components/
└── MyNewComponent/
├── MyNewComponent.tsx         # Main component logic and JSX

├── MyNewComponent.module.css  # CSS Modules for styling (or other standard)

├── MyNewComponent.test.tsx    # Unit/Component tests (Jest/RTL)

└── index.ts                   # Optional: Barrel file for exporting

## 3. Implementation Steps

1. **Create Component File (`.tsx`):**
    * Define the component function using React functional components and hooks.
    * Define the `Props` interface using TypeScript.
    * Implement the component's rendering logic using JSX. Use semantic HTML elements.
    * Implement state management using `useState`.
    * Implement side effects (like data fetching) using `useEffect`.
    * Implement event handlers (e.g., `handleClick`).
2. **Apply Styling (`.module.css`):**
    * Write CSS rules using class names.
    * Import and use the styles object in your `.tsx` file (e.g., `import styles from './MyNewComponent.module.css';`). Apply classes like `className={styles.myClass}`.
3. **Integrate Validation Components:**
    * Import necessary validation components (e.g., `import CoreValuesValidator from '../Validators/CoreValuesValidator';`).
    * Embed them within your component's JSX where appropriate.
    * Pass required props (data to validate, rules, API schemas, context, callback functions) as detailed in [`UI Validation Examples`](./ui_validation_examples.md).
    * Use the feedback/state provided by the validation components to modify your component's behavior (e.g., disable buttons, show error messages).
4. **TypeScript:** Use TypeScript rigorously for props, state, function signatures, and variables to catch type errors early.
5. **Accessibility:** Add necessary ARIA attributes, ensure proper focus management, use descriptive labels/alt text.

## 4. Testing

* **Create Test File (`.test.tsx`):** Use Jest and React Testing Library (RTL).
* **Basic Rendering:** Test that the component renders without crashing.
* **Props Handling:** Test that the component renders correctly with different prop values.
* **State Changes:** Test that internal state updates correctly based on interactions.
* **Event Handlers:** Test that callback props are called when expected (e.g., button clicks). Use RTL's `fireEvent` or `userEvent`.
* **Validation Integration:**
  * Test that validation components are rendered when expected.
  * Mock the validation components' callbacks/behavior to test how *your* component reacts to validation success or failure (e.g., ensure a button is disabled when validation fails).
* **Accessibility Testing:** Consider adding `@axe-core/react` for automated accessibility checks within your tests.
* **Mocking:** Mock API calls (`frontend/src/services/`), context providers, or complex child components as needed to isolate the component under test.

```typescript
// Example Test Snippet (MyNewComponent.test.tsx)
import React from 'react';
import { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event'; // Recommended for user interactions
import MyNewComponent from './MyNewComponent';

// Mock validation component if needed
jest.mock('../Validators/CoreValuesValidator', () => ({ textToValidate, onValidationResult }) => {
  // Simplified mock behavior
  const isValid = !textToValidate.includes('invalid');
  React.useEffect(() => {
    onValidationResult(isValid, isValid ? [] : ['Contains invalid text']);
  }, [textToValidate, onValidationResult, isValid]);
  return <div data-testid="mock-validator">{isValid ? 'Valid' : 'Invalid'}</div>;
});

describe('MyNewComponent', () => {
  it('renders correctly with initial props', () => {
    render(<MyNewComponent initialValue="test" />);
    expect(screen.getByLabelText('My Input:')).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(screen.getByRole('button', { name: 'Submit' })).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it('updates input value on change', async () => {
    render(<MyNewComponent initialValue="" />);
    const input = screen.getByLabelText('My Input:');
    await userEvent.type(input, 'new value');
    expect(input).toHaveValue('new value');
  });

  it('disables submit button when validator marks input as invalid', async () => {
     render(<MyNewComponent initialValue="" />);
     const input = screen.getByLabelText('My Input:');
     const submitButton = screen.getByRole('button', { name: 'Submit' });

     await userEvent.type(input, 'some valid text');
     // Assuming validator passes for this text based on mock
     expect(submitButton).not.toBeDisabled();
     expect(screen.getByTestId('mock-validator')).toHaveTextContent('Valid');


     await userEvent.clear(input);
     await userEvent.type(input, 'contains invalid text');
     // Assuming validator fails for this text based on mock
     expect(submitButton).toBeDisabled(); // Check component reaction
     expect(screen.getByTestId('mock-validator')).toHaveTextContent('Invalid');
   });

  // Add more tests for edge cases, props, callbacks etc.
});
5. Integration
Import and use your new component within parent components or pages (frontend/src/pages/).
Pass necessary props down from the parent.
Ensure data flows correctly (fetching data, passing callbacks).
Perform manual testing in the browser across different scenarios.
By following these steps, you contribute high-quality, consistent, testable, and ethically-aligned UI components to ThinkAlike.
