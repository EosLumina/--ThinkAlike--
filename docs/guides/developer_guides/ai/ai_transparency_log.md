# AI Transparency Log

**Description:**
A user-readable log that outlines the data that influences AI decisions, the parameters being used, and ethical implications, with actionable tools to validate and modify those choices. The AI Transparency Log is a critical UI component for fulfilling ThinkAlike's commitment to algorithmic transparency and user trust. It empowers users to understand the inner workings of the platform's AI systems, fostering a sense of control and informed engagement with AI-driven functionalities.

**UI Components:**

* **AI Decision Log:**
  A scrollable log of all AI decisions and actions relevant to the user, presented in an inverted chronological order for easy review of recent AI activity.
  * **Implementation:**
    The AI Decision Log displays a chronologically ordered, scrollable list of all AI decisions and actions that directly impact the user's experience or data. Each log entry should include:
    * **Timestamp:** Clear timestamp indicating when the AI decision or action occurred.
    * **Action Description:** A concise and user-friendly description of the AI action (e.g., "Generated Matching Recommendations," "Personalized Narrative Path," "Community Recommendation").
    * **Data Inputs (Linked to Data Explorer Panel):** Hyperlinks or interactive elements linking each log entry to the Data Explorer Panel, allowing users to seamlessly access and examine the specific data points that served as inputs for that particular AI decision, enhancing data traceability and user understanding of AI-driven choices.
    * **Ethical Parameter Definitions (Linked to Ethical Guidelines):** Concise summaries of the relevant ethical parameters and guidelines that were considered by the AI during its decision-making process, with direct links to the full Ethical Guidelines document for users who wish to delve deeper into the ethical framework underpinning each AI action.
  * **Code Parameters:**
    The AI Decision Log component is implemented using reusable UI components and a data-driven architecture, allowing for dynamic population of log entries from various AI modules and decision-making processes across the ThinkAlike platform. Key code parameters include:
    * `decisionLogEntries: Array<DecisionLogEntryObject>` - Accepts an array of DecisionLogEntryObjects, each object representing a single AI decision log entry with properties for `timestamp`, `actionDescription`, `dataInputs: Array<DataPointID>`, and `ethicalParameters: Array<EthicalGuidelineID>`.
    * `maxLogEntries: Number` - Numeric parameter to control the maximum number of log entries displayed in the scrollable log, optimizing UI performance and preventing overwhelming users with excessively long logs (with options for users to load more entries or filter log history).
    * `filterOptionsEnabled: Boolean` - Boolean flag to enable/disable filter options for users to filter log entries by AI module, action type, data input, or time range, empowering users with granular control over log viewing and analysis.
  * **Testing Instructions:**
    To validate the AI Transparency Log component, implement the following test scenarios:
    * **Decision Logging Accuracy Tests:** Systematically trigger various AI-driven functionalities across the ThinkAlike platform (e.g., running Matching Algorithm, generating Narrative Mode content, providing community recommendations) and rigorously verify that all relevant AI decisions and actions are accurately logged in the AI Decision Log, ensuring comprehensive and reliable logging of AI activity.
    * **Data Input Traceability Validation:** Validate data input traceability by creating test cases where users interact with AI-driven features and verifying that the AI Decision Log accurately links each log entry to the corresponding Data Points in the Data Explorer Panel, enabling users to seamlessly trace the data inputs that influenced specific AI decisions and validate data provenance and algorithmic transparency.
    * **Ethical Parameter Definition Linking Tests:** Rigorously test the linking of Ethical Parameter Definitions by verifying that each log entry accurately links to the relevant Ethical Guidelines document and that users can readily access and review the ethical parameters considered by the AI during each decision-making process, enhancing user understanding of the ethical framework guiding AI behavior.
    * **UI Performance and Scalability Tests (Log Rendering):** Conduct performance tests to evaluate the rendering efficiency and scalability of the AI Transparency Log, particularly when displaying a large number of log entries and complex data visualizations, ensuring smooth and responsive UI performance even with extensive AI activity logging.

* **Data Influence Map:**
  A visual graph (node network) that showcases the influence of every data point in AI-driven recommendations and decisions, providing a dynamic and intuitive representation of AI reasoning processes.
  * **Implementation:**
    The Data Influence Map utilizes a network graph visualization (leveraging `DataTraceability.jsx` or a similar graph visualization library) to visually represent the influence of different data points on specific AI decisions. The graph should:
    * **Node Representation of Data Points:** Represent key data points (from the user's Value Profile, activity data, or other relevant sources) as interconnected nodes within the graph visualization.
    * **Edge Representation of Influence Relationships:** Utilize edges (lines or arrows) to visually represent the influence relationships between data points and specific AI decisions or recommendations. Edge thickness or color intensity can be used to indicate the strength or weighting of influence for different data points.
    * **Dynamic Graph Rendering:** Dynamically render the graph based on the specific AI decision or recommendation being examined, highlighting the data points that were most influential in that particular AI output and tailoring the visualization to the specific context of the user's query or action.
    * **Interactive Exploration and Data Highlighting:** Enable interactive exploration of the Data Influence Map, allowing users to:
      * Hover over nodes (data points) to view detailed information about the data element and its specific contribution to the AI decision.
      * Click on edges (influence relationships) to view explanations of *how* a particular data point influenced the AI's output, providing user-friendly insights into the algorithmic reasoning process.
      * Zoom and pan within the graph to explore complex data influence networks and navigate large datasets.
  * **Code Parameters:**
    The Data Influence Map component is implemented using reusable graph visualization libraries (e.g., react-force-graph, vis.js) and a data-driven architecture, allowing for dynamic generation of data influence graphs based on AI decision-making processes and data flow analysis.

    * `interactionEnabled: Boolean` - Boolean flag to enable/disable user interaction features within the graph (hover tooltips, node/edge selection, zoom/pan), empowering users to explore and analyze data influence patterns interactively.
  * **Testing Instructions:**
    To validate the Data Influence Map component, implement the following test scenarios:
    * **Data Influence Mapping Accuracy Tests:** Rigorously test the accuracy of data influence mapping by creating diverse test cases with varying data inputs and AI decision scenarios, verifying that the Data Influence Map accurately represents the actual data points and influence relationships driving AI outputs, ensuring visual fidelity and accurate algorithmic depiction.
