## Purpose

Continuously monitor and audit outputs from various AI engines (text, voice, image) to detect biases related to gender,
ethnicity, or other protected characteristics.

## Expected Inputs

```json

{
  "module": "AI Text Analysis Engine",
  "bias_flag": false,
  "confidence": 98,
  "notes": "No significant bias detected."
}

```

## Integration

* UI dashboards display bias detection metrics.

* Enables continuous improvement efforts in model training.
* Integrated with the AI Transparency Log for recordkeeping.

## Ethical Considerations

* Regular audits to ensure fairness.

* Transparency in bias detection results.
* User empowerment through visibility into AI decision-making.
