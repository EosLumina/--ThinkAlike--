# AI Risk Mitigation Framework

## Purpose
This document provides a structured approach to identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks associated with AI implementations in ThinkAlike. It ensures that AI systems are robust, ethical, and aligned with user empowerment principles.

## Key Risk Categories
1. **Bias and Fairness Risks:** Risks of perpetuating or amplifying biases in AI outputs.
2. **Transparency Risks:** Risks of opaque decision-making processes.
3. **Privacy Risks:** Risks of unauthorized data access or misuse.
4. **Security Risks:** Risks of adversarial attacks or data breaches.
5. **User Agency Risks:** Risks of diminishing user control or autonomy.

## Risk Mitigation Strategies
- **Bias Mitigation:** Regular audits, diverse training datasets, and fairness metrics.
- **Transparency Enhancements:** Use of explainable AI (XAI) techniques and UI-driven validation.
- **Privacy Safeguards:** Data minimization, encryption, and consent-driven workflows.
- **Security Measures:** Adversarial testing, rate limiting, and secure API design.
- **User Empowerment:** Clear UI controls for overriding AI decisions and managing data.

## Integration with ThinkAlike
- **Verification System:** Tracks and logs risk assessments.
- **UI Components:** Displays risk mitigation measures to users.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Regular updates based on user feedback and new risks.
