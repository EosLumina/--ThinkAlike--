# API Documentation Guidelines

---

## 1. Introduction

This guide outlines the standards and best practices for documenting APIs in the ThinkAlike project. Good API documentation is crucial for both internal development and potential external integrations. These guidelines ensure that our API documentation is consistent, complete, and useful for all stakeholders.

## 2. Documentation Framework

ThinkAlike uses a combination of the following tools for API documentation:

### 2.1 OpenAPI/Swagger

* All REST APIs should be documented using OpenAPI Specification (formerly Swagger)
* FastAPI automatically generates OpenAPI documentation from Python type hints and docstrings
* The API documentation is accessible at `/docs` endpoint in the running application
* Standalone OpenAPI JSON files should be stored in `docs/api/` directory for reference

### 2.2 Markdown Documentation

* Additional context, guides, and examples should be provided in Markdown files
* API overview documents should be stored in `docs/api/` directory
* Complex workflow examples should be included in the developer guides

## 3. Documentation Requirements

Every API endpoint must document the following:

### 3.1 Basic Information

* **Summary:** A short one-line description of what the endpoint does
* **Description:** More detailed explanation including use cases and important notes
* **Endpoint Path:** The URL path with clear parameter placeholders
* **HTTP Method:** GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, etc.
* **Tags:** Categorical tags for grouping related endpoints

Example:
```yaml
/users/{user_id}:
  get:
    summary: Get user profile details
    description: Retrieves detailed profile information for a specific user. Requires authentication.
    tags:
      - Users
