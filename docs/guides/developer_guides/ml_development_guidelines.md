def split_dataset(X, y, test_size=0.2, val_size=0.2, random_state=42):
    """Split dataset into train, validation, and test sets."""
    # First split off test set
    X_train_val, X_test, y_train_val, y_test = train_test_split(
        X, y, test_size=test_size, random_state=random_state, stratify=y
    )

    # Then split training into train and validation
    # Adjust validation size to account for the test split
    relative_val_size = val_size / (1 - test_size)
    X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(
        X_train_val, y_train_val, test_size=relative_val_size,
        random_state=random_state, stratify=y_train_val
    )

    # Log split sizes
    logger.info(f"Train set: {len(X_train)} samples")
    logger.info(f"Validation set: {len(X_val)} samples")
    logger.info(f"Test set: {len(X_test)} samples")

    return (X_train, y_train), (X_val, y_val), (X_test, y_test)
```

## 4. Model Development

### 4.1 Model Selection

Consider the following when selecting a model type:

* **Interpretability requirements**
* **Data characteristics**
* **Performance requirements**
* **Inference time constraints**
* **Maintainability**

Document the rationale for model selection.

### 4.2 Training Practices

* **Reproducibility**: Set and document random seeds
* **Hyperparameter tuning**: Use systematic approaches (grid search, Bayesian optimization)
* **Training history**: Log training metrics and hyperparameters
* **Resource utilization**: Monitor and optimize computational resource usage

```python
# Example hyperparameter tuning with logging
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
from mlflow import log_params, log_metrics

def tune_model(model_class, param_grid, X_train, y_train, X_val, y_val):
    """Tune model hyperparameters and log results.

    Args:
        model_class: Sklearn-compatible model class
        param_grid: Dictionary of hyperparameters to search
        X_train/y_train: Training data
        X_val/y_val: Validation data

    Returns:
        best_model: Tuned model instance
    """
    # Create search
    search = GridSearchCV(
        model_class(),
        param_grid,
        cv=5,
        scoring='f1_weighted',
        verbose=1,
        n_jobs=-1
    )

    # Fit search
    search.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Log hyperparameter search results
    log_params(search.best_params_)
    log_metrics({
        'train_f1': search.best_score_,
        'val_f1': search.score(X_val, y_val)
    })

    logger.info(f"Best parameters: {search.best_params_}")
    logger.info(f"Best training F1: {search.best_score_:.4f}")
    logger.info(f"Validation F1: {search.score(X_val, y_val):.4f}")

    return search.best_estimator_
```

### 4.3 Model Architecture Documentation

Document the following for each model:

* **Architecture diagram** (for neural networks)
* **Layer descriptions**
* **Input and output specifications**

---

## 5. Evaluation and Validation

### 5.1 Evaluation Metrics

Select appropriate metrics for your problem type:

* **Classification**: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1, AUC-ROC
* **Regression**: MSE, MAE, RMSE, R-squared
* **Ranking**: NDCG, MAP, MRR
* **Recommendation**: Precision@K, Recall@K, MAP@K

Always document why specific metrics were chosen.

### 5.2 Validation Strategies

Use appropriate validation strategies:

* **Simple holdout**: For large datasets with balanced distributions
* **K-fold cross-validation**: For smaller datasets
* **Stratified sampling**: For imbalanced datasets
* **Time-based splits**: For time-series data

```python
# Example time-based validation for recommendation models
def time_based_validation(user_item_interactions, n_splits=5):
    """Create time-based train/validation splits.

    Args:
        user_item_interactions: DataFrame with user_id, item_id, timestamp
        n_splits: Number of validation folds to create

    Returns:
        list: List of (train_indices, val_indices) tuples
    """
    # Sort interactions by timestamp
    sorted_data = user_item_interactions.sort_values('timestamp')

    # Calculate split points
    split_size = len(sorted_data) // (n_splits + 1)
    split_indices = [split_size * i for i in range(1, n_splits + 1)]

    # Create train/validation splits
    splits = []
    for i in range(n_splits):
        train_end = split_indices[i]
        if i < n_splits - 1:
            val_end = split_indices[i + 1]
        else:
            val_end = len(sorted_data)

        train_indices = sorted_data.index[:train_end]
        val_indices = sorted_data.index[train_end:val_end]

        splits.append((train_indices, val_indices))

    return splits
```

### 5.3 Baseline Models

* Implement simple baseline models for comparison
* Document baseline performance
* Use baselines to validate the value of complex models

### 5.4 A/B Testing

* Design robust A/B tests for model deployment
* Define clear metrics for success
* Calculate required sample size and duration
* Document test results and statistical significance

---

## 6. Fairness and Bias Mitigation

### 6.1 Fairness Metrics

Evaluate models for fairness across sensitive attributes:

* **Demographic parity**: Similar prediction rates across groups
* **Equalized odds**: Similar error rates across groups
* **Equal opportunity**: Similar true positive rates across groups
* **Disparate impact**: Ratio of positive prediction rates between groups

### 6.2 Bias Detection

* Identify potential bias in training data
* Monitor distributions of predictions across groups
* Test for statistically significant differences
* Document findings and mitigation steps

```python
# Example fairness evaluation
from fairlearn.metrics import demographic_parity_difference

def evaluate_fairness(y_true, y_pred, sensitive_features):
    """Evaluate fairness metrics for a model.

    Args:
        y_true: Ground truth labels
        y_pred: Model predictions
        sensitive_features: DataFrame with sensitive attributes

    Returns:
        dict: Dictionary of fairness metrics
    """
    fairness_metrics = {}

    # Compute demographic parity for each sensitive attribute
    for column in sensitive_features.columns:
        dp_diff = demographic_parity_difference(
            y_true, y_pred, sensitive_features=sensitive_features[column]
        )
        fairness_metrics[f'demographic_parity_diff_{column}'] = dp_diff

        logger.info(f"Demographic parity difference for {column}: {dp_diff:.4f}")

    return fairness_metrics
```

### 6.3 Bias Mitigation Techniques

When bias is detected, consider:

* **Pre-processing**: Modify training data to remove bias
* **In-processing**: Incorporate fairness constraints during training
* **Post-processing**: Adjust predictions to ensure fairness

Document all bias mitigation approaches and their effects.

### 7.2 Explanation Requirements

Document the following for each model:

* **Global explanations**: Overall model behavior
* **Local explanations**: How specific predictions are made
* **Counterfactual explanations**: What changes would alter predictions
* **Limitations**: What the model cannot explain

```python
# Example SHAP value calculation
import shap

def explain_model(model, X, feature_names=None):
    """Generate SHAP explanations for a model.

    Args:
        model: Trained model
        X: Feature matrix to explain
        feature_names: List of feature names

    Returns:
        shap_values: SHAP values for explanations
    """
    # Create explainer
    if hasattr(model, 'predict_proba'):
        explainer = shap.KernelExplainer(model.predict_proba, shap.sample(X, 100))
    else:
        explainer = shap.KernelExplainer(model.predict, shap.sample(X, 100))

    # Calculate SHAP values
    shap_values = explainer.shap_values(X)

    # Generate summary plot
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
    shap.summary_plot(shap_values, X, feature_names=feature_names)
    plt.savefig('shap_summary.png')

    # Log feature importance
    if feature_names:
        importances = np.abs(shap_values).mean(axis=0)
        importance_df = pd.DataFrame({
            'feature': feature_names,
            'importance': importances
        }).sort_values('importance', ascending=False)
        logger.info(f"Feature importance:\n{importance_df.head(10)}")

    return shap_values
```

    Returns:
        model: Trained model
    """
    # Start MLflow run
    with mlflow.start_run(run_name=model_name) as run:
        run_id = run.info.run_id
        logger.info(f"Started MLflow run: {run_id}")

        # Log parameters
        mlflow.log_params(params)

        # Create and train model
        model = create_model(params)
        model.fit(X_train, y_train)

        # Evaluate model
        metrics = evaluate_model(model, X_test, y_test)
        mlflow.log_metrics(metrics)

        # Log model
        mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, "model")

        # Log feature names
        if hasattr(X_train, 'columns'):
            feature_names = X_train.columns.tolist()
            mlflow.log_param("feature_names", feature_names)
