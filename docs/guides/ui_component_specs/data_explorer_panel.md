## UI Components

### Data Point List

* **Description:**
  Displays categorized data points with tooltips for detailed information and data traceability.

* **Implementation:**
  * Data points are displayed in a vertically scrollable, categorized list using clear and concise labels.
  * Each data point entry is enhanced with distinct icons indicating its data source (e.g., user input, AI output, external API) and data type (e.g., text, numerical, categorical, media).
  * Tooltips, activated on hover or tap, provide expanded details including:
    * **Data Origin:** For example, "User Profile Input - 'Values' Section", "Narrative Mode Interaction - 'Choice #3 Response'", "AI Recommendation Algorithm - 'Matching Percentage Score'".
    * **Data Transformations:** Steps such as "Anonymized using differential privacy techniques", "Vectorized for AI model input", "Aggregated for community-level metrics".
    * **AI Usage Context:** Information on how the data point is used (e.g., "Used by Matching Algorithm to calculate Value Alignment Score", "Contributes to AI Agent's personalized narrative generation", "Utilized for community recommendation engine").

* **Code Parameters:**
  * `dataPoints: Array<DataPointObject>`
    *(Each DataPointObject represents a single data point with properties for `label`, `value`, `source`, `dataType`, `transformations`, and `aiUsageContext`.)*
  * `categories: Array<String>`
    *(Defines data categories for list organization and filtering.)*
  * `tooltipEnabled: Boolean`
    *(Enables/disables tooltip functionality for detailed data traceability.)*
  * `searchFilterEnabled: Boolean`
    *(Enables/disables search filtering of data points within the list.)*

* **Testing Instructions:**
  * **Real Use Case Scenarios:** Populate the list with diverse and realistic data profiles.
  * **Data Integrity Validation:** Verify that the displayed data accurately reflects the underlying data.
  * **Tooltip Functionality Testing:** Ensure tooltips display detailed data origin, transformations, and AI usage context.
  * **Search Filter Testing:** Confirm that search queries filter the data points correctly.

### Data Visualization

* **Description:**
  Offers different graph templates for dynamic and user-friendly data analysis and pattern recognition.

* **Implementation:**
  Provides a selection of reusable graph templates dynamically populated with user data. Available graph templates include:

  * **Timeline View:**
    Visualizes data evolution over time, allowing users to track trends in their Value Profile and activity patterns.

  * **Bar Graph View:**
    Compares different data categories and highlights dominant values or skill areas.

  * **Circular Diagram View:**
    Represents data distribution as a pie chart, offering a holistic view of the data composition.

  * **Personal Data Network Graph:**
    Uses the `DataTraceability.jsx` component to display a network graph of interconnected data points, mapping relationships within the user's data ecosystem.

* **Code Parameters:**
  * `graphType: Enum<"timeline", "barGraph", "circularDiagram", "networkGraph">`
    *(Selects the graph type dynamically.)*
  * `data: Array<DataPointObject>`
    *(Dynamically populates the graph with user data.)*
  * `visualizationConfig: Object`
    *(Customizes the graph appearance including colors, labels, axes, and interactive elements such as tooltips, zoom, and pan.)*

* **Testing Instructions:**
  * **Graph Type Rendering Validation:** Test each graph type with diverse datasets.
  * **Data Mapping Accuracy Tests:** Verify correct mapping of data values to visual elements.
  * **User Customization Parameter Validation:** Ensure the visualization reflects user customization options.
  * **Performance and Scalability Tests:** Confirm efficient rendering under heavy data loads.

### Privacy Settings

* **Description:**
  Actionable options for users to control data visibility and usage preferences.

* **Implementation:**
  The Privacy Settings section offers:

  * **Visibility Controls:**
    Toggle buttons or dropdowns allowing users to set data point visibility (e.g., "Public," "Private," "Connections Only," "Community Members Only").

  * **Data Usage Permissions:**
    Checkboxes or option buttons for opting in or out of certain data usage scenarios such as matching recommendations, community insights, or non-essential data usage.

  * **Data Retention Controls:**
    Time-based options that allow users to set data retention preferences (e.g., "Keep data indefinitely," "Automatically delete data after 3 months of inactivity," "Manually delete data at any time").

* **Code Parameters:**
  * `visibilitySettings: Object<DataPointID, Enum<"public", "private", "connections", "community">>`
    *(Defines visibility for each data point.)*
  * `dataUsagePermissions: Object<DataUsageScenario, Boolean>`
    *(Specifies permissions for data usage scenarios.)*
  * `dataRetentionPolicy: Enum<"indefinite", "3monthsInactive", "userControlled">`
    *(Defines the user's data retention policy.)*

* **Testing Instructions:**
  * **Visibility Control Enforcement Tests:** Validate that data access aligns with the user’s visibility settings.
  * **Data Usage Permission Enforcement Tests:** Simulate different usage scenarios to confirm permissions are enforced properly.
  * **Data Retention Policy Validation Tests:** Check that data deletion occurs as specified.
  * **UI Feedback and Actionability Tests:** Ensure the UI reflects changes and provides clear feedback regarding privacy settings.

### Data Flow Panel

* **Description:**
  A dynamic diagram displaying in real time how user data is processed, stored, and used. The panel shows API calls, database requests, and code implementations in a user-understandable format.

* **Implementation:**
  Utilizes an interactive diagram to represent:

  * **Real-Time Data Rendering:** Updates dynamically as users interact with data settings.
  * **Workflow Step Visualization:** Displays key steps from UI input to API calls, database requests, AI processing, and data persistence.
  * **Code Implementation Highlighting:** Links UI interactions to the corresponding backend code components.
  * **Security Protocol Indicators:** Shows active security measures at each stage of the data flow.

* **Code Parameters:**
  * `dataFlowData: Array<DataFlowStepObject>`
    *(Each object represents a step with properties for `stepName`, `componentName`, `apiCall`, `databaseRequest`, `securityProtocol`, and `dataStatus`.)*
  * `visualizationType: Enum<"diagram", "flowchart", "network">`
    *(Selects the visualization style.)*
  * `realTimeDataEnabled: Boolean`
    *(Enables/disables real-time data updates.)*

* **Testing Instructions:**
  * **Workflow Step Accuracy Tests:** Verify the diagram accurately represents all steps.
  * **Real-Time Data Update Validation:** Test the dynamic updates when data or settings change.
  * **Code Traceability and Workflow Mapping Accuracy:** Ensure each UI step correctly correlates with its backend component.
  * **Performance and Responsiveness Tests:** Confirm smooth performance during real-time rendering.
