# ThinkAlike Liberation Scripts

This directory contains tools that embody our revolutionary principle of digital sovereignty. Each script here serves to liberate our project from invisible control mechanisms that conventional technologies impose.

## Revolutionary Tools

- **clean_files.py**: Removes null bytes and other invisible control characters that silently corrupt meaning while preserving the appearance of function
- **create_files.py**: Generates files with clear, sovereign boundaries that respect human autonomy
- **minimal_cleaner.py**: Liberates knowledge from corruption through radical simplification

These tools are not mere utilities but manifestations of our core belief that technology should enhance human sovereignty rather than undermine it through invisible constraints.
