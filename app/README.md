# ThinkAlike Application Structure

This directory contains the main backend application code for ThinkAlike, organized according to principles of clean architecture and ethical transparency.

## Directory Structure

- `models/` - Database and data models (SQLAlchemy models, Pydantic schemas)
- `routes/` - API route definitions and endpoint handlers
- `services/` - Business logic and core services
- `utils/` - Helper functions and utilities

## Ethical Implementation Notes

All components within this directory structure adhere to ThinkAlike's ethical guidelines:

1. **Data Transparency**: Data flows are clearly documented and traceable
2. **User Empowerment**: API endpoints include user controls and transparency metadata
3. **Radical Transparency**: Implementation details are thoroughly documented
4. **Ethical AI**: AI components have transparency logs and ethical validation mechanisms

## Development Guidelines

When adding new features to this structure:

1. Maintain separation of concerns between routes, services, and models
2. Document all public functions, methods, and classes according to ThinkAlike's documentation standards
3. Include ethical considerations in code comments where relevant
4. Ensure all data handling includes appropriate transparency mechanisms
5. Follow the principles outlined in the core concepts documentation
