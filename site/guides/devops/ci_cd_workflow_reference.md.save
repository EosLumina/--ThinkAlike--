## 1. Introduction

This document provides a reference implementation and best practices for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) workflows within the ThinkAlike project using GitHub Actions. Consistent and reliable CI/CD pipelines are essential for automating testing, ensuring code quality, maintaining documentation integrity, and enabling smooth deployments.

This guide complements the [DevOps Workflow Guide](./devops_workflow.md) (if it exists, otherwise integrate here) and specific deployment guides like the [Render Deployment Guide](../implementation_guides/deployment_guide.md).

## 2. Core Goals of ThinkAlike CI/CD

- **Quality Assurance:** Automatically run linters, formatters, unit tests, and integration tests on every push/PR.
- **Ethical Validation:** Integrate checks related to ethical guidelines where possible (e.g., running specific ethical tests, checking documentation for keywords - requires custom scripting).
- **Documentation Integrity:** Automate documentation builds, link checks, and potentially deployment to the docs site.
- **Dependency Security:** Automatically scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
- **Deployment Automation:** Enable automated (or manually triggered) deployments to staging and production environments upon successful checks.
- **Consistency:** Ensure all checks run in a consistent environment.

## 3. Recommended Workflow Structure (GitHub Actions)

We recommend separate workflows for different concerns (e.g., Backend CI, Frontend CI, Docs CI, Deployment).

### Example: Backend CI Workflow (`.github/workflows/backend_ci.yml`)

This workflow runs on pushes/PRs targeting `main` for the backend code.

```yaml
# filepath: .github/workflows/backend_ci.yml
name: Backend CI Checks

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
    paths:
      - 'backend/**'
      - 'requirements.txt'
      - '.github/workflows/backend_ci.yml'
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
    paths:
      - 'backend/**'
      - 'requirements.txt'
      - '.github/workflows/backend_ci.yml'

jobs:
  lint-test-backend:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    defaults:
      run:
        working-directory: ./backend

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/ch
